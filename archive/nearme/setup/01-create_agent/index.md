Sync with Google Business Profile Account
-------------------------------------

To begin setting up your virtual agent, navigate to the Business tab in the Near Me Messaging Portal. Here you will see the business locations associated with your Google account. If you donâ€™t see your locations, ensure that you are logged in with the account associated with your Google Business Profile account, and click on the *"Sync"* button to resync your locations.

Test/Chat with Near Me Agent
----------------------------

When your agent is finished building, you will see test QR codes on your screen. Scanning these QR codes will bring you to a private test version of your virtual agent. This version of your virtual agent will not appear on Google Maps yet, but you can talk to it and test the responses.
