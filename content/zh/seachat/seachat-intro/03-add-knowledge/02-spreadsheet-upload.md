## 概述
SeaChat 提供四種方法來上傳文件到您的助理。在本教學指南中，我們將專注於“上傳試算表”的方法，在本教學結束時，您的 SeaChat 助理將擁有一個客製的知識庫為您服務。

## 創建 SeaChat 助理

如果你還沒有 Seachat 帳號，你可以在 [SeaChat 網站](https://chat.seasalt.ai/) 免費註冊！你可以在 [創建助理](/zh/seachat/seachat-intro/02-create-agent/) 找到所有你需要的資訊。

## Step 2: Open Knowledge Base
在側邊欄中，選擇“助理設定”下的“知識庫”面板。通過選擇“上傳試算表”，您可以上傳 .csv 或 .xlsx 文件到您的助理。
Find your agent's knowledge base by navigating to the "Knowledge Base" dashboard under "Agent Configuration" in the sidebar menu. By choosing "Upload Spreadsheet", you can upload a .csv or .xlsx file to your agent.

## Step 3: Upload File
By clicking on the upload button, you can submit to your agent choosing from various file formats[^1]. The file will be processed and the knowledge base will be updated accordingly once submitted.

## Step 4: Before Submission
SeaChat allows users to upload in bulk. You can see the status of each uploading file in the section below the drag-and-drop zone.
