SeaMeet is an easy-to-use meeting AI copilot that helps you transcribe, record, and analyze your meetings in REAL TIME.

We recommend taking the first step by installing our browser extension so you will always have SeaMeet on your side in meetings: 


<div class="row justify-content-center">
    <div class="col-lg-9 col-xl-8 text-center">
        <p class="lead"></p>
        <a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg px-4 mb-2" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/seameet-ai-meeting-minute/gkkhkniggakfgioeeclbllpihmipkcmn" role="button">Install SeaMeet Extension</a>
    </div>
</div>

SeaMeet also offers support to many different browsers, including Arc, Brave, and Edge. You can install the extension via the link above. SeaChat also works seamlessly with Google Meet. You can directly connect your Google Calendar to SeaMeet and let the copilot join automatically or manually insert the Google Meeting code to start the recording.
