The Overview Page is the first page you see in your agent’s portal, and gives you basic information about your agent at a glance. At the top of the page you will see the launch status of your agent. Once your agent is publicly launched, you will also see some basic statistics about your agent here as well.

The Welcome Message section allows you to change the first message your customers see when they start chatting with your virtual agent. This is a good place to put short term information you want your customers to know, like irregular hours or daily offerings.

The Improvements section provides helpful links to other pages where you can provide custom information to improve the performance of your virtual agent. See the Improve You Agent section for more information about these methods.

Once your virtual agent is launched, the Unanswered Questions section will show you common questions that your virtual agent is struggling to answer. This is a great starting point to add more FAQs to improve your agent.

Finally, the Overview page has your Private Testing QR codes and links to the Public Launch page, for easy access to your virtual agent.

You can improve your agent by adding information about these missing attributes at https://business.google.com or on the Google My Business app.

The Customer Review Insights section shows you the most common topics that appear in your Google Reviews. This is a great place to look to get an idea of what your customers are saying in your reviews, without having to read through all of them.
