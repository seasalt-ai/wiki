## Authorize Seasalt.ai on Google Business Profile

In this video, we show the process of authorizing Seasalt.ai to access your virtual agent through Google Business Profile. This allows Seasalt.ai access to your virtual agent on the Near Me Messaging website, and enables us to better assist you if you need help with your virtual agent.

## Google Permissions in Near Me Messaging

Near Me Messaging requries access to your Google Business Profile data. While there are a number of permissions listed in the request, Near Me Messaging and Seasalt.ai only uses read permissions when interacting with your business data. However, Google does not allow us to request just read-only access, and so Near Me Messaging must ask for all permissions.

This allows your Near Me virtual agent access to information about your business to answer your customer's questions, and allows Seasalt.ai to publicly launch your virtual agent on Google Maps on your behalf.
