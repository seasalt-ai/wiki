## Check if the preparation step is done

To proceed with the configuration of the call forwarding, we need to make sure that we have deployed a phone number that will be answered by SeaChat AI agents. If you haven't done this, Please check out our [tutorial](https://wiki.seasalt.ai/seachat/inbound-voice-agent/call-forwarding/) on how to do so. 

## Forward your Business calls to SeaChat

Forwarding business calls can be more complex than forwarding personal calls.
