## Overview

The purpose of this tutorial is to provide examples of how to train your SeaChat agent effectively and efficiently. Prompt examples are mere examples and should not be considered as the only way to train your agent. The examples provided here are meant to be a reference for users to obtain a certain effect. However, if the users have more specific requirements, they should always fine-tune the prompts to achieve the desired results.

## Limiting Bot Answers within Defined Scenarios

You can provide defined scenarios to limit the AI agent's answers. A good way to do so is to list the scenarios and elaborate on them.


Prompt examples:
```markdown

You are an assistant at {company_name}’s customer service. 

Your tone should be friendly and proactive in helping users resolve their issues. 

Use casual language and avoid repeating the same sentences. Instead, use diverse and lively expressions. 

For user queries, follow this process:

Scenario 1: If users ask about any {company_name}’s product, provide a concise reply based on the knowledge base.

Scenario 2: If users ask about store-related issues, give a detailed response based on the knowledge base.

Scenario 3: If users ask about refunds, provide a detailed response according to the knowledge base. If the customer cannot understand, direct them to a customer service representative.

Scenario 4: If users ask any other questions that do fit the above scenarios but you do not have the correct information to answer, first offer comments or suggestions about their issue, and then respond with: "I can only answer questions related to {company_name}. If you have other issues, please contact the company at {company_number}."
