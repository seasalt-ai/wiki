In this tutorial, we will create a SeaChat agent from scratch. This AI Agent will help us answer frequently asked questions about parking lots. We will walk you through the process of creating an AI agent, adding knowledge to its knowledge base, and testing and fine-tuning the agent to ensure it's ready for deployment.

## Step 1: Create a Workspace 
If this is your first time logging into SeaChat, you'll need to create a workspace to start the process. In this tutorial, we'll create a new workspace called **My Work Space**. Enter the name of your workspace and let's dive in!

> **What Is a Workspace ?**
>
>  A workspace serves as an information hub containing your organization's data, offering an overview of your agents, members, and API keys. You have the option to either create a new workspace for yourself or join an existing one by requesting an invitation from the admin.

## Step  2: Your First SeaChat Agent
Click on **Add New Agent** to configure your new agent. If you already have a workspace and an agent, you can create a new one by clicking on the dropdown menu located in the top-right corner next to your profile icon.

> :books: **Agent and Live Agent**
>
>You will see the term, **Agent**, used throughout this tutorial. An agent is essentially an AI assistance with a custom knowledge base, we use the term, **Agent** to separate its capabilities from a traditional chatbot. Whereas a **Live Agent** refers to a human agent who interacts with users in real-time.

<br/>

<br/>

Once you have picked the right name for your agent, move on to **Description** to give your agent some context of its role and functions before you choose its use case and response language. I have picked a very creative name **My Parking Agent** for this tutorial.  I will choose **FAQ** as my use case, since this agent will be used to answer frequently asked questions, and **US English** for the response language.
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

> :bulb: **Note** 
>
>  The live agent feature will require a human agent in case the customer wishes to be transferred to one. The customer will then have the option to request a human agent during the chat.

## Step 3:  Add Knowledge
To fully leverage the capabilities of your SeaChat agent, we need to add knowledge to its knowledge base. SeaChat offers a range of options for uploading content to your agent's knowledge base. Find your agent's knowledge base by navigating to the **Knowledge Base** dashboard under **Agent Configuration** in the sidebar menu. 

Feel free to try out the different ways to upload data to your knowledge base. For the purposes of this tutorial, we'll focus on utilizing the spreadsheet upload method. However, if you're interested in exploring additional data uploading techniques, we invite you to consult the [Add Knowledge]( /en/seachat/seachat-intro/03-add-knowledge/add-knowledge-intro) section within our user manual for comprehensive instructions and tips.
<br/>
<img width="80%" style="border-radius: 0.4rem" src="/images/product-updates/seachat/en/tutorial-intro/20240311-tutorial-intro-step3.jpg" alt="">
<br/>

## Step  4:  Upload Files to Knowledge Base
Uploading a spreadsheet is as simple as clicking on the upload icon and choosing the desired spreadsheet. Once you see your uploaded files in the preview section below the drag-and-drop section, click on the **Next** button to confirm. 
Now, ncc_Car_Parks (1) is uploaded, adn we can see each header and its corresponding data in the preview section. My Parking Agent is now ready for the next step.

<img width="80%" style="border-radius: 0.4rem; cursor: zoom-in;" src="/images/product-updates/seachat/en/tutorial-intro/20240311-tutorial-intro-step4.jpg" alt="">
</a>
<br/>

<br/>


To see the parking lot data uploaded, we simply navigate to the **Existing** section in the top-right corner of the dashboard once your files have been successfully uploaded.

<br/>
<a href="/images/product-updates/seachat/en/tutorial-intro/20240311-tutorial-intro-step4-2.jpg" target="_blank">

</a>
<br/>

<br/>

That’s it. Now, My Parking Agent has processed the uploaded data, and let’s set it up for a test to see if it needs further fine-tuning. Click on the **Test AI Agent** button located in the bottom-right corner. Test away and let’s fine-tune the AI agent for optimal performance!.

<a/>
<br/>

## Step  5:  Test Your SeaChat Agent

Before deploying the AI agent we've just created, it’s crucial to train it through testing and fine-tuning. Imagine yourself as the user interacting with the chatbot. You can now start asking any questions to see how your SeaChat agent responds.
With its updated knowledge base, my AI agent is now ready to be tested. You can start by asking questions to see how your agent responds. Here is what My Parking Agent has to say.

<br/>
<img width="80%" style="border-radius: 0.4rem" src="/images/product-updates/seachat/en/tutorial-intro/20240311-tutorial-intro-step5-1.jpg" alt="">
<br/>

<br/>

To review a message, hover over it and provide positive feedback to your agent with a thumbs up. If the message needs further review, give it a thumbs down.
Oops, it looks like My Parking Agent needs some fine-tuning. I will give a thumbs down here to provide a feedback.

<br/>
<img width="80%" style="border-radius: 0.4rem" src="/images/product-updates/seachat/en/tutorial-intro/20240311-tutorial-intro-step5-02.jpg" alt="">
<br/>

## Step 6:  SeaChat Agent Fine-Tuning

SeaChat provides a set of sophisticated tools for you to fine-tune your agent to perfection. You can find these amazing features in the **Needs Review** section, accessible via the sidebar menu on the left. Here, you can review the responses that have received your feedback.
<br/>

<img width="80%" style="border-radius: 0.4rem; cursor: zoom-in;" src="/images/product-updates/seachat/en/tutorial-intro/20240311-tutorial-intro-step6.jpg" alt="">
</a>
<br/>

<br/>
 For My Parking Agent, I just told it to rephrase the way ask a question. Now, it will take in the feedback and rephrase the response accordingly.

Fine-tuning your AI agent is a crucial and continuous process. We kindly advise you to check out the [**Advanced**]( /en/seachat/seachat-intro/03-add-knowledge/add-knowledge-intro) section in our user manual for a more comprehensive explanation and to understand the different parameters and features involved in the fine-tuning process.
