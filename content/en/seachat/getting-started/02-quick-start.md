## Step 1: Create a Workspace 
If this is your first time logging into SeaChat, you will have to create a workspace to kickstart the process. Enter the name of your workspace and let’s begin!

## Step  2: Your First SeaChat Agent
Click on **Add New Agent** to configure your new agent. If you already have a workspace, you can click on the **My Agent** in the top-right corner to create a new agent.

<br/>

Once you have picked the right name for your agent, move on to **Description** to give your agent some context of its role and functions before you choose its use case and response language.

>  The live agent feature will require a human agent in case the customer wishes to be transferred to one. The user will then have the option to request a human agent during the chat.

## Step 3:  Add Knowledge
To fully leverage the capabilities of your SeaChat agent, we need to add knowledge to its knowledge base. SeaChat offers a range of options for uploading content to your agent's knowledge base. Find your agent's knowledge base by navigating to the **Knowledge Base** dashboard under **Agent Configuration** in the sidebar menu. 

Feel free to try out the different ways to upload data to your knowledge base. For the purposes of this tutorial, we'll focus on utilizing the spreadsheet upload method. However, if you're interested in exploring additional data uploading techniques, we invite you to consult the [Add Knowledge]( /en/seachat/seachat-intro/03-add-knowledge/add-knowledge-intro) section within our user manual for comprehensive instructions and tips.

<br/>

## Step  4:  Upload Files to Knowledge Base
Uploading a spreadsheet is as simple as clicking on the upload icon and choosing the desired spreadsheet. Once you see your uploaded files in the preview section below the drag-and-drop section, click on the **Next** button to confirm.

<br/>

<br/>

Navigate to the **Existing** section in the top-right corner of the dashboard once your files have been successfully uploaded.

<br/>

<br/>

That’s it. Now, your SeaChat agent has processed the uploaded data, and let’s set it up for a test to see if the AI agent needs further fine-tuning. Click on the **Test AI Agent** button located in the bottom-right corner. Test away and let’s fine-tune the AI agent for optimal performance!.

<br/>

## Step  5:  Upload Files to Knowledge Base

Before deploying the AI agent we've just created, it’s crucial to train it through testing and fine-tuning. Imagine yourself as the user interacting with the chatbot. You can now start asking any questions to see how your SeaChat agent responds.

<br/>

<br/>

Your role as a tester involves verifying if our agent produces the correct responses based on the data uploaded to its knowledge base, and determining if the responses require linkage with external data or additional information. To review a message, hover over it and provide positive feedback to your agent with a thumbs up. If the message needs further review, give it a thumbs down.

<br/>

## Step 6:  SeaChat Agent Fine-Tuning

Fine-tuning your AI agent is a crucial and continuous process. SeaChat provides a set of sophisticated tools for you to fine-tune your agent to perfection. You can find these amazing features in the **Needs Review** section, accessible via the sidebar menu on the left. Here, you can review the responses that have received your feedback.
