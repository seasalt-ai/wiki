In this tutorial, we will create a SeaChat agent from scratch. This AI agent will help answer FAQs about a parking lot business. We will walk you through the process of creating the AI agent, adding knowledge to its knowledge base, testing and fine-tuning the agent to ensure it's ready to answer all incoming questions from customers!

## Step 1: Create a Workspace 
If this is your first time logging into SeaChat, you'll need to create a workspace to start the process. I named my new workspace as **My Work Space**. You can give your workspace a different name!

</a>
<br/>

> **What Is a Workspace ?**
>
>  A workspace serves as an information hub containing your organization's data, offering an overview of your agents, members, and API keys. You have the option to either create a new workspace for yourself or join an existing one by requesting an invitation from the admin.

## Step  2: Your First SeaChat Agent
Click on **Add New Agent** to configure your new agent. If you already have a workspace and an agent, you can create a new one by clicking on the dropdown menu located in the top-right corner next to your profile avatar.

> :books: **AI Agent and Live Agent**
>
>You will see the term, **Agent**, used throughout this tutorial. An **AI agent** is essentially an AI assistance with a custom knowledge base, we use the term to emphasize its capability to assist your customers like a real human agent. Whereas a **Live Agent** refers to an actual human agent who interacts with customers in real-time.

</a>
<br/>

<br/>

Once you have picked the right name for your agent, move on to **Description** to give your agent some context of its role and functions before you choose its use case and response language. After picking a creative name **My Parking Agent** for this tutorial, I will choose **FAQ** as my use case, since this agent will be used to answer frequently asked questions, and **US English** for the response language.
<br/>

</a>
<br/>

<br/>

> :bulb: **Note** 
>
>  The live agent feature will require a human agent in case the customer wishes to be transferred to one. If you choose this option, the customer will then have the option to request a human agent during the chat, and you should arrange a human agent to respond to ongoing conversations.
> 

## Step 3:  Add Knowledge
To fully leverage the capabilities of your SeaChat agent, we need to add knowledge to its knowledge base. SeaChat offers a range of options for uploading content to your agent's knowledge base. Find your agent's knowledge base by navigating to the **Knowledge Base** dashboard under **Agent Configuration** in the sidebar menu. 

Feel free to try out the different ways to upload data to your knowledge base. For the purposes of this tutorial, we'll focus on utilizing the **Upload Spreadsheet** method. However, if you're interested in exploring additional data uploading techniques, we invite you to take a look at the [Add Knowledge]( /en/seachat/seachat-intro/03-add-knowledge/add-knowledge-intro) section within our user manual for comprehensive instructions and tips.

<br/>
<a href="/images/product-updates/seachat/en/tutorial-intro/20240311-tutorial-intro-step3.jpg" target="_blank">
<img width="80%" style="border-radius: 0.4rem;cursor: zoom-in;" src="/images/product-updates/seachat/en/tutorial-intro/20240311-tutorial-intro-step3.jpg" alt="">
<a/>
<br/>

## Step  4:  Upload Files to Knowledge Base
Uploading a spreadsheet is as simple as clicking on the upload icon and choosing the desired spreadsheet. Once you see your uploaded files in the preview section below the drag-and-drop section, click on the **Next** button to confirm. 
Now, my CSV file, ncc_Car_Parks (1) is uploaded, and we can see each header and its corresponding data in the preview section. My Parking Agent is now ready for the next step. 

Download the sample .csv file [here](/sample-files/ncc_Car_Parks.csv), and try it out yourself.

<br/>

<img width="80%" style="border-radius: 0.4rem; cursor: zoom-in;" src="/images/product-updates/seachat/en/tutorial-intro/20240311-tutorial-intro-step4.jpg" alt="">
</a>
<br/>

<br/>


To see the uploaded data of parking lots, we simply navigate to the **Existing** section in the top-right corner of the dashboard once your files have been successfully uploaded.

<br/>
<a href="/images/product-updates/seachat/en/tutorial-intro/20240311-tutorial-intro-step4-2.jpg" target="_blank">
<img width="80%" style="border-radius: 0.4rem; cursor: zoom-in;" src="/images/product-updates/seachat/en/tutorial-intro/20240311-tutorial-intro-step4-2.jpg" alt="">
</a>
<br/>

<br/>

That’s it. Now, My Parking Agent has processed the uploaded data, and let’s set it up for a test to see if it needs further fine-tuning. Click on the **Test AI Agent** button located in the bottom-right corner. Let's try chatting with My Parking Agent to see if we can optimize its performance!

<img width="80%" style="border-radius: 0.4rem;cursor: zoom-in;" src="/images/product-updates/seachat/en/tutorial-intro/20240311-tutorial-intro-step4-3.jpg" alt="">
<a/>
<br/>

## Step  5:  Test Your SeaChat Agent

Before putting the AI agent we've just created into action, it’s crucial to train it through testing and fine-tuning. Imagine yourself as the customer interacting with the AI agent. You can now start asking any questions to see how your SeaChat agent responds.
With its updated knowledge base, My Parking Agent is now ready to be tested. You can start by asking questions to see how your agent responds. Here is what my agent has to say.

<br/>
<img width="80%" style="border-radius: 0.4rem" src="/images/product-updates/seachat/en/tutorial-intro/20240311-tutorial-intro-step5-1.jpg" alt="">
<br/>

<br/>

To review a message, hover over it and provide positive feedback to your agent with a thumbs up. If the message needs further review, give it a thumbs down.

Oops, it looks like My Parking Agent needs some fine-tuning. I will give a thumbs down here to provide a feedback.

<br/>
<img width="80%" style="border-radius: 0.4rem" src="/images/product-updates/seachat/en/tutorial-intro/20240311-tutorial-intro-step5-2.jpg" alt="">
<br/>

## Step 6:  SeaChat Agent Fine-Tuning

SeaChat provides a set of sophisticated tools for you to fine-tune your agent to perfection. You can find these amazing features in the **Needs Review** section, accessible via the sidebar menu on the left. Here, you can review the responses that have received your feedback.

<br/>
<a href="/images/product-updates/seachat/en/tutorial-intro/20240311-tutorial-intro-step6-1.jpg" target="_blank">
<img width="80%" style="border-radius: 0.4rem; cursor: zoom-in;" src="/images/product-updates/seachat/en/tutorial-intro/20240311-tutorial-intro-step6-1.jpg" alt="">
</a>
<br/>

<br/>

It looks like the information about Unicorn Road Car Park is missing in the knowledge base of My Parking Agent. I need to click on the CSV file that the missing information belongs to and add it.

<br/>
<a href="/images/product-updates/seachat/en/tutorial-intro/20240311-tutorial-intro-step6-2.jpg" target="_blank">
<img width="80%" style="border-radius: 0.4rem" src="/images/product-updates/seachat/en/tutorial-intro/20240311-tutorial-intro-step6-2.jpg" alt="">
<a/>
<br/>

<br/>

Now, click save once you are sure of the uploaded information. Don't forget to click on **Move to Reviewed** to consolidate your changes.
You can switch to **Reviewed** section to see the changes you've made. All done! Now, let's test the agent again to see if it has improved.

<br/>
<a href="/images/product-updates/seachat/en/tutorial-intro/20240311-tutorial-intro-step6-3.jpg" target="_blank">
<img width="80%" style="border-radius: 0.4rem; cursor: zoom-in;" src="/images/product-updates/seachat/en/tutorial-intro/20240311-tutorial-intro-step6-3.jpg" alt="">
</a>
<br/>

Ta-da! My Parking Agent now is giving me the right information. It is that easy! You can now try it out yourself and see how your agent performs.
