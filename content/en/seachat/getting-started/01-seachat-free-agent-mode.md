## How to Start using SeaChat for free?

### Step 1
Open an account at [SeaChat](https://chat.seasalt.ai/?utm_source=wiki). No credit card required. Our onboarding process will guide you through creating your first SeaChat agent. There’s only one thing you need to do to **use SeaChat without incurring extra costs — choose Human Agent Only under the Conversation Handling Mode option**.

*Choose Human Agent Only Mode*
</center>

**You will start with the free plan. You will only need to upgrade to a paid plan if you need to use AI-powered responses.**

The Human Agent Mode includes:
- Incoming message support across multiple channels (Web Chat – widget for your website, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, LINE)
- Manual response capability through a unified conversation panel (You will personally respond to all messages)
- Quota: 1 Agent, 1 user account, and 1 workspace
- No hidden costs or usage limits

### Step 2
Install your new SeaChat agent to your [website](https://wiki.seasalt.ai/en/seachat/manual/channels/webpage/), [Facebook Messenger](https://wiki.seasalt.ai/en/seachat/manual/channels/facebook-messenger/), [WhatsApp](https://wiki.seasalt.ai/en/seachat/integrations/whatsapp/), and/or [LINE](https://wiki.seasalt.ai/en/seachat/manual/channels/install-to-line/).

### Step 3
Scale your business without spending money on customer service chatbots – until you need to.

## When do I need to pay?

We’ll support you in responding to customers manually across channels for free, as long as you need to scale your business.

Our customers often choose to upgrade to a paid SeaChat plan when they need to:

- Respond to many customer queries
- Provide prompt, intelligent, automated responses
- Answer based on a custom knowledge base
- Have 24/7 customer support
- Take customer phone calls
- Focus on more important tasks rather than handling repetitive requests

With SeaChat, you can enable or disable AI support anytime without changing your existing setup on all the channels. Enjoy the flexibility of on-demand AI support.
