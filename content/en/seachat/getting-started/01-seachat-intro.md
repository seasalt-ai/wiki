- Quota: 1 Agent, 1 user account, and 1 workspace
- No hidden costs or usage limits

### Step 2

## When do I need to pay?

Weâ€™ll support you in responding to customers manually across channels for free, as long as you need to scale your business.

Our customers often choose to upgrade to a paid SeaChat plan when they need to:

- Respond to many customer queries
- Provide prompt, intelligent, automated responses
- Answer based on a custom knowledge base
- Have 24/7 customer support
- Take customer phone calls
- Focus on more important tasks rather than handling repetitive requests

With SeaChat, you can enable or disable AI support anytime without changing your existing setup on all the channels. Enjoy the flexibility of on-demand AI support.
