Build and launch a GPT chat and voice agent in 10 minutes. Multilingual support. Live agent transfer. Integrate with webchat, SMS, Line, CRM, Shopify, calendars, Twilio, ZenDesk, and phone calls. You can upload your knowledge base (we support more than 30 document types including pdf, csv, doc, png, jpg etc) and customize an AI agent in under 10 minutes.

 Once the agent is made, you can connect it to both text and voice channels, including LINE, website, WhatsApp, and phone calls. You can purchase a phone number on SeaChat and connect it to your voice agent. It automatically responds to common customer queries and seamlessly transitions to human customer service representative when needed.
