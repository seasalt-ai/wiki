Congratulations on successfully launching SeaChat to your selected channels ‚Äì website, WhatsApp, or others. We are only half way there. This guide walks you through the remaining steps to ensure a successful operation on a daily basis.

## Setup

### 1. Add More Members to your Workspace

</a>

*Workspace ‚Üí Members*

</center>

If you haven‚Äôt done so already, you can go to *Workspace* ‚Üí *Members* to add your team there.

Note that there are [three roles](https://wiki.seasalt.ai/en/seachat/workspace/workspace-management/#members): Admin, AI Agent Editor, and Human Agents.

Human Agents won‚Äôt be able to see how you‚Äôve configured your AI agent, they are just there to reply to incoming messages.

Your AI Agent Editor can modify your AI Agent. So be very careful with assigning such roles.

If you have **multiple AI Agents**, you can assign different human agents to different AI agents.

### 2. Enable Email Notification

You should ask each of your agents to enable email notifications at *Workspace* ‚Üí *Preference*.

</a>

*Enable Email Notification on SeaChat*

</center>

In this way you‚Äôll be notified as soon as someone starts chatting with your AI agent. Then you can choose whether to chime in.

### 3. Consider Enabling Form on Web Widget

If you use a webchat widget, visitors might not leave their phone number, name, or email. You won‚Äôt know whom you are chatting with. In this case, you can go to *Channels* ‚Üí *Webchat Widget* ‚Üí *Custom Forms* to force visitors to fill in their contact details before chatting:

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center; justify-content: space-between; gap: 20px;">
    <div style="width: 100%; text-align: center; display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
        <a href="/images/seachat/en/post-launch-sop/web-widget.png" target="_blank" style="width: 100%; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; overflow: hidden;">
            <img style="width: auto; height: 200px; border-radius: 0.4rem; cursor: zoom-in;" src="/images/seachat/en/post-launch-sop/web-widget.png" alt="">
        </a>
        <p style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 15px">Custom Form in WebChat Widget</p>
    </div>
    <div style="width: 100%; text-align: center; display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
        <a href="/images/seachat/en/post-launch-sop/web-widget-form.png" target="_blank" style="width: 100%; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; overflow: hidden;">
            <img style="width: auto; height: 200px; border-radius: 0.4rem; cursor: zoom-in;" src="/images/seachat/en/post-launch-sop/web-widget-form.png" alt="">
        </a>
        <p style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 15px">Create WebChat Widget</p>
    </div>
</div>

## Daily Routine

### What Human Agents Should Do

Every day, your agent should do two things:

- Go to Conversations and reply to incoming inquiries
- Mark anything that‚Äôs answered not well by the AI Agent using üëé
- Mark anything that‚Äôs answered well by Human Agents using üëç

### What AI Agent Editor and Admin Should Do

Every day, your AI Agent Editor or Admin should do three things:

- Go to Conversations and watch how the AI Agents and Human Agents replied to your customers
- Mark anything that‚Äôs answered not well by the Human Agent using üëé
- Mark anything that‚Äôs answered well by Human Agents using üëç

Once the AI Agent Editor or Admin identified areas that need improvement, they can go to the *Needs Review* session and start adding or modifying the Knowledge Base:

</a>

*Conversations that need reviews*

</center>

## Weekly Routine

Every week for about 30 minutes to 1 hour, the Admin should work with the AI Agent Editor in the following areas:

*Improve the knowledge base*
- Review the *Needs Review* session and revise the knowledge base
- KB revision includes not only addition, but also removing old stale articles.

*Use Knowledge Base to improve your website*
- Discuss what‚Äôs being added to the knowledge base
- If there are commonly asked questions, consider adding them to your website.

*Use your website to improve your Knowledge Base*
- If you recently have written more documents, and you want the AI Agents to know, you can go to the Knowledge Base to import them.
- If your website changed, you can re-import them by clicking on the *Sync Now* button.

*Update Knowledge Base for improvement*

## Keep Iterating

The AI Agents know about two things:
- what they are trained to know about your business
- world knowledge about some common sense and facts

It is your responsibility to improve them on a daily and weekly basis to make it better, so that your human agents will do less and less work!
