A live agent is a human agent who can take over the conversation from the chatbot agent when needed. Not only can live agents take over the conversation, but they can also provide the virtual agent with new knowledge, and help train the virtual agent by testing and fine-tuning the response of the chatbot agent.

Depending on your SeaChat channel, it might take different configurations to enable the live agent feature. SeaChat offers many integration configurations and channels. We recommend you to refer to [Integration](/en/seachat/seachat-manual/integrations/) or [Channels](/en/seachat/seachat-manual/channels/) to learn how to set up your agent properly.

In this tutorial, we will show you how to transfer to a live agent during chat conversations and how to set it up, using the different methods that SeaChat provides.

## Setting it up

Before you integrate your custom AI agent into your production, we need to make sure that the live agent feature is enabled in your SeaChat account. Go to **Agent Information** under **Agent Configuration**. You can see all the basic settings for your AI agent. If you want to reconfigure your agent or simply to have an overview of your agent. You can do them all here.

At the bottom of the screen, you can see the checkbox that says ***Users can request a live agent during chat***. Make sure to check this box to enable the live agent feature.

> :exclamation: **IMPORTANT** :exclamation:
> 
> If you chose to enable the feature of the live agent, your customer will now have the option to request a live agent during the chat conversation. This requires you to provide a real-human agent that will monitor and response to the user.

## Talk to Customer as a Live Agent
Find the **Conversations** section from the sidebar menu on the left. Here you can see all the conversations that your AI agent has had with your customers. You can see the conversation history and the status of the conversation and this is the control center of your live agent's conversation.

If a customer requests a live agent during the chat conversation, the human agent will see the notification pops up to indicate that the request. If the list of conversation gets too long, simply click on the **Live Agent** button to see the list of conversations that live agents need to complete.
