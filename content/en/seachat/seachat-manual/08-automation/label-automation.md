**Overview**  

Label Automation is a feature in SeaChat that allows users to define actions triggered when labels are applied or removed from conversations. 

It builds upon the [Auto Labeling](https://wiki.seasalt.ai/seachat/manual/labeling/lauto-labeling/) feature by introducing workflows to notify or escalate important events automatically.

This tutorial walks you through setting up Label Automation, providing practical examples to enhance your workflow.

   - **Action**: Send an email and SMS to the relevant healthcare team.

2. **Code Yellow - Moderate Conditions**  
   - **Trigger**: Apply **Code Yellow** for cases such as moderate pain or fever.  
   - **Action**: Notify relevant staff via email.
