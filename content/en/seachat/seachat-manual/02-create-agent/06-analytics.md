## SeaChat Analytics
### Overview
The SeaChat Analytics feature provides valuable insights into user interactions with your AI chatbot. This dashboard enables you to track key performance metrics over time, helping measure engagement, optimize chatbot performance, and make data-driven decisions. Navigate to the `Analytics` tab below `Agent Configuration` to view the analytics page for a specific bot.

ðŸ“Š Track Chatbot Performance
Monitor the number of conversations, unique visitors, and message activity to understand how users are engaging with your chatbot.

ðŸ“ˆ Measure Growth and Trends
Compare data across different time ranges (Last 7 Days, Last 30 Days, etc.) to identify trends in chatbot usage and user behavior.

ðŸ¤– Optimize Chatbot Responses
Analyze bot message statistics to see how effectively the chatbot is handling conversations and refine responses for better user satisfaction.

ðŸ‘¥ Improve Customer Engagement
By tracking live agent requests and user interactions, businesses can identify opportunities to enhance customer support and automation strategies.

ðŸ”„ Data-Driven Decision Making
Use real-time analytics to refine chatbot workflows, improve response accuracy, and optimize user experience based on actual usage patterns.

### Settings

At the top of the page, there are a couple settings you can configure. First, select the timezone you would like the data to be presented in. Second, check the box for whether or not you would like to include conversations that have *no messages from the user*. For example, if a user opens the webchat and reads the welcome message, but does NOT send a message, the conversation will still be created and show up in the conversation statistics. If you check the setting box, conversations like this with no user messages will be *excluded* from the statistics.

By default, the dashboard data will update every hour. If you would like to refresh the data on demand, click the "Refresh Data" button.

**SeaChat Analytics Basic Metrics**
</center>

The Metrics section in SeaChat Analytics provides a detailed breakdown of your chatbot's performance over a selected time range. You can customize the date range by choosing from:

- Last Day
- Last 7 Days
- Last 30 Days
- Last 90 Days
- Last 180 Days

Once a time range is selected, SeaChat will compare the chatbot's performance during that period to the same length of time immediately before it. For example:

> If you select Last 7 Days, the displayed metrics will compare the last 7 days to the previous 7-day period.

> If you select Last 30 Days, it will compare the last 30 days to the 30 days before that.

#### Understanding the Metrics
The key performance indicators (KPIs) displayed include:

- Conversations â€“ The total number of chatbot interactions initiated during the selected time period.
- Unique Visitors â€“ The number of distinct users who interacted with the chatbot.
- Messages Received â€“ The number of messages sent by users to the chatbot.
- Bot Messages Sent â€“ The number of responses generated by the chatbot.
- Live Agent Requests â€“ The number of times users requested a human agent.
- Agent Messages Sent â€“ The number of messages sent by live agents in conversations.

Each metric includes a percentage change indicator, showing how it has increased or decreased compared to the previous equivalent time period. Green arrows indicate positive growth, while red arrows (if applicable) indicate a decline.

This comparison helps businesses track chatbot performance trends over time, evaluate improvements, and identify areas for optimization.

**Conversation Yearly Overview**

The Conversation Overview section in SeaChat Analytics provides a high-level summary of chatbot interactions for a selected year. Users can choose a specific year from the dropdown menu to view key statistics on chatbot engagement during that period.

- Total Number of Conversations â€“ Displays the total count of chatbot conversations for the selected year.
Average Number of Messages Per Conversation â€“ Shows the average number of messages exchanged per conversation, helping assess user engagement levels.
- Total Messages by Month

Below the key metrics, a line graph visualizes the total number of messages exchanged with the chatbot each month. This allows users to:

- Identify trends in chatbot activity over time.
- Spot seasonal fluctuations or spikes in engagement.
- Assess the impact of business campaigns or chatbot improvements on conversation volume.

### Conversation & Messages Breakdown

The Conversations Breakdown by Day, Time & Channel section allows users to analyze chatbot interactions across various channels and time periods within a custom date range. By selecting a specific start and end date, businesses can gain detailed insights into when and where most of their interactions are occurring.
