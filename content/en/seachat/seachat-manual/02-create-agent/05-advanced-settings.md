### Agent Memory
Agent memory fields are used to extract information from a conversation and store it for future reference. Memory is a powerful yet complex feature. We recommend you refer to the [Agent Memory](/seachat/seachat-manual/02-create-agent/03-agent-memory/) tutorial to learn more about how to set up memory fields for your AI agent. It is a powerful feature that allows you to understand your user in real-time conversations and gather information before engagement.

### Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
RAG settings provide ways for SeaChat users to customize how knowledge is considered in real time retrieval. different RAG strategy works for different types of knowledge base. SeaChat wants our users to have the flexibility to choose the best RAG strategy that fits their use case.
