#### Overview

The Knowledge Base References feature in SeaChat by Seasalt.ai provides a convenient way to link back to documents used to generate chat responses. When enabled, each chat response will include a References section that lists the source documents, allowing users to see exactly what information contributed to the response.

#### How to Enable Knowledge Base References

To enable this feature, follow these steps:

1. **Go to the Agent Information \-\> Advanced Settings** tab
2. **Toggle Knowledge Base References**
   - Find the Knowledge Base References setting and switch it on to activate the feature.

</a>
<br/>

</center>

Once enabled, the References section appears under the AI Agentâ€™s responses, displaying the names of the Knowledge Base documents that SeaChat used to generate the answer. If the source is a clickable URL, it will be displayed as a link for easy access. This allows users to verify the sources and gain a better understanding of how responses are formed.

#### What Kind of Knowledge Base Entries Show as References?

The types of Knowledge Base entries that can appear as references include:

#### **1\. URL-Based Entries**

Web pages or publicly accessible articles added to the KB. When the chatbot retrieves information from a URL, the reference appears as a clickable link.

</a>
<br/>

_Example: AI agent response displays two clickable urls._

#### **2\. Manual Knowledge Base Entries**

Custom text-based knowledge entries manually added. These are typically short documents or FAQs written in SeaChatâ€™s _Write a New KB Document_ page. The reference will display the title of the manual KB entry.

#### **3\. Uploaded Files**

- Excel Files (.csv, .xls, .xlsx, .xlsm, .xlsb, .odf, .ods and .odt)

- Documents (.doc, .docx, .eml, .epub, .gif, .jpg, .json, .html, .msg, .odt, .ogg, .pdf, .png, .pptx, .ps, .rtf, .tiff, .txt, .zip)
