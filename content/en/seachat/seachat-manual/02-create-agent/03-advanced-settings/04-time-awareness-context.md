## Overview

In addition to the [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://wiki.seasalt.ai/seachat/seachat-manual/02-create-agent/03-advanced-settings/02-retrieval-augmented-generation-rag/) feature and [Memory](https://wiki.seasalt.ai/seachat/seachat-manual/02-create-agent/03-advanced-settings/03-agent-memory/), SeaChat AI offers various options in advanced settings that allow users to further control their agent’s behavior.

While these features are less sophisticated than RAG and Memory, they can still be valuable in certain situations. This article provides a general walkthrough of these features.

## Time Awareness

The time awareness feature enables the AI agent to understand the current time in a specified timezone. This is useful for delivering time-sensitive information to customers. For instance, a time-aware agent can be set up to share your business hours or assist with appointment scheduling.

## Context

The context feature lets users define the maximum number of conversation turns the AI agent should consider when generating responses. This is helpful when you want to offer contextually aware responses without referencing the entire conversation history.

By limiting the number of conversational turns, users can reduce response latency and avoid overwhelming the AI agent with excessive information.
