## Creating a New AI Agent 

If this is your first time using SeaChat, you will need to create a new agent. After creating your workspace or being invited to one, SeaChat will take you to the agent creation page.  

Sometimes you might want to create a new agent for different use cases, languages, or different agent description. SeaChat allows users to create an agent from scratch or to apply predefined use cases. Now, let's see how we can create a new agent using the two different methods.

First, let's start by using the **Add New Agent** button located next to your avatar.
<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
<div style="width: 100%; text-align: center; display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; justify-item: center">
  <a href="/images/seachat/en/create-a-new-agent/create-new-agent-shortcut.png" style="height: 200px; width: 100%; height: 100%;display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; overflow: hidden;" target="_blank">
<img width="60%" style="border-radius: 0.4rem; cursor: zoom-in;" src="/images/seachat/en/create-a-new-agent/create-new-agent-shortcut.png" alt="">
</a>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 15px">Create a New Agent Shortcut</p>
</div>
</div>

## Agent Creation Setup

Before we can start with the agent configuration, we have to first choose the method of creating the agent. You can either create an agent from scratch or pick a use case that suits your agent's purpose. 

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
<div style="width: 100%; text-align: center; display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; justify-item: center">
  <a href="/images/seachat/en/create-a-new-agent/choose-creation-method.png" style="height: 200px; width: 100%; height: 100%;display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; overflow: hidden;" target="_blank">
<img width="100%" style="border-radius: 0.4rem; cursor: zoom-in;" src="/images/seachat/en/create-a-new-agent/choose-creation-method.png" alt="">
</a>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 15px">Choose Agent Creation Method</p>
</div>
</div>

<br/> 

### Name and Response Language

Pick a name for your agent. You can pick a name that describes the task that the agent will be responsible for. For example, I have an agent called Customer Service Agent here that should tell you right away what it does.

In **Preferred Response Language**, pick a language that the agent will use to answer to your customer. I pick US English for the purpose of this tutorial.

### Live Agent
Finally, you can enable the feature of [live agent](/en/seachat/seachaat-manual/02-create-agent/02-live-agent-transfer) by checking the **Users can request a live agent during chat**.

### Use Case and Description

Depending on your choice of method to create an agent, your setup for the agent will be slightly different.

Generally speaking, your choice of use case will help the agent to understand what kind of conversation it will be having with your customers. Whereas your description will help the agent to understand the context of the conversation.

We will look into the difference in these two methods below:

## Custom AI Agent: Creating from Scratch

If you wish to configure your agent to your existing prompt description or a brand-new definition, you might want to create it from scratch, since it offers you the full control to customize your agent description. For users who already have instructions in place, this is the best way to go.

Choose a use case for your agent, and simply input the description that defines your agent's behavior. Once you are done with the setup, click on **Create** to finish the process.

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
<div style="width: 100%; text-align: center; display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; justify-item: center">
  <a href="/images/seachat/en/create-a-new-agent/start-from-scratch.png" style="height: 200px; width: 100%; height: 100%;display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; overflow: hidden;" target="_blank">
<img width="80%" style="border-radius: 0.4rem; cursor: zoom-in;" src="/images/seachat/en/create-a-new-agent/start-from-scratch.png" alt="">
</a>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 15px">Create an AI Agent from Scratch</p>
</div>
</div>

## Click to Start: Pick a Use Case

A use case can help you to quickly set up your agent and get started with your conversation. Pick a use case that suits your agent's purpose, and all that is left to do is to further define your agent's description.

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
<div style="width: 100%; text-align: center; display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; justify-item: center">
  <a href="/images/seachat/en/create-a-new-agent/pick-a-use-case.png" style="height: 200px; width: 100%; height: 100%;display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; overflow: hidden;" target="_blank">
<img width="100%" style="border-radius: 0.4rem; cursor: zoom-in;" src="/images/seachat/en/create-a-new-agent/pick-a-use-case.png" alt="">
</a>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 15px">Pick a Use Case</p>
</div>
</div>

<br/> 

Different from starting from scratch, a use case comes with predefined instructions that SeaChat has prepared for you. You can enter your own description that will later be appended to these instructions. By doing this, you can provide context to your agent along with the predefined instructions.

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
<div style="width: 100%; text-align: center; display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; justify-item: center">
  <a href="/images/seachat/en/create-a-new-agent/choose-a-use-case.png" style="height: 200px; width: 100%; height: 100%;display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; overflow: hidden;" target="_blank">
<img width="100%" style="border-radius: 0.4rem; cursor: zoom-in;" src="/images/seachat/en/create-a-new-agent/choose-a-use-case.png" alt="">
</a>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 15px">Define Agent Description</p>
</div>
</div>
