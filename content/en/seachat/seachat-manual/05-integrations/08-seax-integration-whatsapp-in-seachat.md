## Overview

[SeaX](https://seax.seasalt.ai) enables businesses to send bulk WhatsApp messages and manage large-scale customer engagement campaigns efficiently. When integrated with SeaChat, SeaX not only allows for outbound messaging at scale but also automates replies to incoming customer responses using AI. This integration streamlines both outbound campaigns and inbound support, making it ideal for organizations handling high message volumes or seeking to automate customer interactions.

3. Once connected, your WhatsApp account will appear in the SeaX workspace channels.

1. Go to the **Conversations** or **Bulk Send/Call** section in SeaX.
2. Select your WhatsApp-enabled number and compose your bulk message.

## Managing Multiple WhatsApp Accounts

SeaX supports the management of multiple WhatsApp business accounts. Add new accounts via **Channels â†’ Add Account** and manage all numbers and agents centrally. Assign different agents to different accounts as needed, and monitor all activity from the unified interface.

---

## Human Agent Takeover

If a customerâ€™s query requires human intervention, agents can take over from the AI at any time. This can be triggered manually or by customer request (e.g., using a command like `/live_agent`). The transition is seamless, and customers cannot distinguish whether they are chatting with an AI or a human unless informed.

---

## Best Practices

- **Obtain Consent:** Only send bulk messages to users who have opted in to receive WhatsApp communications from your business.
- **Personalize Messages:** Use variables and templates to tailor bulk messages for higher engagement.
- **Monitor Campaigns:** Use SeaXâ€™s reporting tools to track delivery, response rates, and campaign effectiveness.
- **Maintain Compliance:** Adhere to WhatsAppâ€™s business messaging policies to avoid account restrictions.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure you are using a permanent access token for WhatsApp API integration.
- Verify that your WhatsApp application is set to Live mode.
- Confirm webhook permissions are correctly configured for message delivery and reception.
- If auto-replies are not functioning, check that the WhatsApp number is correctly linked to both SeaX and SeaChat.
