## Key Features

**Bulk Outbound Calling:**  
Initiate large-scale outbound phone call campaigns to hundreds or thousands of recipients directly from SeaX. Use AI agents to automate surveys, interviews, or notifications.

**AI-Powered Inbound Call Handling:**  
Configure AI agents to answer incoming phone calls, providing instant, consistent responses to customer inquiries at any time, day or night.

**Unified Management:**  
Manage outbound and inbound call campaigns, phone numbers, and AI agents from a single SeaX interface. Synchronize AI agents across SeaX and SeaChat for streamlined configuration.

**Real-Time Transcription and Summaries:**  
Automatically transcribe calls and generate summaries, making it easy to review interactions and extract key information.


## Prerequisites

- SeaX and SeaChat accounts.
- At least one phone number provisioned in SeaX (toll-free or local).
- Administrator privileges to configure integrations and AI agents.

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Assign and Configure a Phone Number

- Log in to SeaX and navigate to **Workspace â†’ Numbers**.
- Select or provision a phone number for outbound and/or inbound calls.
- Click **Edit** on the chosen number.
- Enable the option **AI Agent to answer the phone**.
- Assign an AI agent from your SeaChat workspace to handle inbound calls.

### 2. Synchronize AI Agents

- Ensure your SeaX and SeaChat workspaces are synchronized.
- All AI agents created in SeaChat will be available for assignment in SeaX, allowing for consistent agent behavior across channels.

### 3. Configure Inbound Call Handling

- In SeaChat, go to **Integrations** and select the phone call integration.
- Link the phone number to your chosen AI agent.
- Set preferences such as language, voice (e.g., "Jessica" for text-to-speech), and the greeting message for inbound calls.
- Save your configuration.

### 4. Test Inbound Calls

- Place a test call to your configured number.
- The AI agent should answer with your preset greeting and respond to queries according to its configuration.
- All call transcripts and summaries will be available in both SeaX and SeaChat for review.

### 5. Set Up Outbound Calling Campaigns

- In SeaX, navigate to **Bulk Send/Call** or **Campaigns**.
- Select your phone-enabled number.
- Import or select your contact list (ensure no duplicate contacts).
- Configure your AI agentâ€™s outbound script or survey (e.g., interview questions for a recruitment campaign).
- Schedule or launch the outbound campaign. The AI agent will call each contact and conduct the conversation as configured.
- Monitor campaign progress and review call summaries and extracted responses in real time.

### 6. Manage Inbound Callbacks

- If recipients return missed calls, the same AI agent (or a different one, if configured) will answer and continue the conversation.
- All inbound and outbound call data, including transcripts and summaries, are accessible from both SeaX and SeaChat.

## Managing Multiple Phone Numbers

SeaX supports multiple phone numbers for different campaigns or departments. Assign different AI agents to each number as needed and manage all activity from the unified interface.

## Best Practices

**Avoid Duplicate Contacts:**  
Ensure each phone number appears only once in your contact lists to prevent multiple calls to the same recipient.

**Personalize Campaigns:**  
Tailor outbound call scripts to the campaignâ€™s purpose (e.g., surveys, appointment reminders, customer notifications).

**Monitor and Review:**  
Use SeaXâ€™s reporting tools to track call delivery, response rates, and campaign effectiveness. Review call transcripts and summaries for quality assurance.

**Maintain Compliance:**  
Adhere to telecommunication regulations regarding automated calls and ensure recipients have consented to receive calls where required.

## Troubleshooting

- If inbound calls are not answered by the AI, verify that the phone number is correctly linked to an AI agent in both SeaX and SeaChat.
- For outbound issues, check contact list formatting and ensure no duplicate entries.
- Confirm that your phone numbers are provisioned and active within SeaX.
