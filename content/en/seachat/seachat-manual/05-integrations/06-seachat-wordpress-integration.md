This page details the process for embedding the SeaChat AI agent into your Wordpress website.

## Step 1: Create a SeaChat account
If you do not have a SeaChat account, you can sign up for free at [SeaChat website](https://chat.seasalt.ai/)! Then you can build your AI agent and bring it to your Wix websites.


## Step 2: Open Wordpress and "Appearance"
Go to your Wordpress dashboard for the website of interest. Click on Appearance on the left-hand side menu.

## Step 4: Open "Theme File Editor" and Add SeaChat Code Snippet
Select "Theme File Editor" on the left-hand side menu -> "Theme Footer" on the right-hand side menu. Then, paste the SeaChat code snippet in between `<body>` and `</body>`. Finally, click on `Update File` to save your change.

## Step 5: Save and preview

Review your website now! If you go to your website now, you can see the SeaChat widget in the lower right corner.

**Important Note**: if you want to configure the style of your widget, please go to “Channels” -> “WebChat Widget” -> “Basic Setting”. Your AI Agent will share the same style across your webchat widget channels.
