# Overview

Up to this point, you've likely only seen SeaChat respond to text-based user chat messages. However, SeaChat has the capability to handle multimedia messages, such as audio and image, as well! This makes interactions more flexible and convenient for users, enabling them to share content in various formats for richer communication.

## Audio Understanding

Some channels, such as Messenger, WhatsApp, and Line, allow users to send audio messages. SeaChat uses speech-to-text technology to convert the audio message into text, which is then processed as the user’s input. This feature ensures that even spoken messages can receive accurate and relevant responses from SeaChat. For users, this adds a layer of convenience, enabling hands-free communication in situations where typing might be difficult or less efficient.

### Example

In the following example, a user chats with the Seasalt.ai bot on WhatsApp and uses the "Voice Note" feature to send an audio message to the agent. By transcribing the audio first with speech-to-text, SeaChat is able to understand and respond to the audio message.
