## ðŸ”– FAQ

### How do the customers know that the Live Agent has left the chat?

When the Live Agent finishes a conversation, he/she can click on the **Complete** button. The customer will see a message saying that **the Live Agent has left the conversation.**

</a>

</center>
<br/>

### Can I set an activation time for my AI Agent to start the conversation automatically? 

Currently, we do not support setting an activation time for the AI Agent to start the conversation automatically. However, you can easily turn on the AI Agent by clicking on **Complete** button in a conversation once you have finished your conversation. Refer to our [tutorial](/en/seachat/seachat-manual/02-create-agent/02-live-agent-transfer) for more information.

### Can I see the response of the AI Agent in the LINE chat?

Yes, you can see both the agent's and live agent's responses. You will have a complete overview of the chat. However, we recommend using SeaChat's conversation platform to have a better overview and control of all the conversations.

### Why is the user interface of my LINE chat in English when the language setting is set to Chinese in my Agent Information?

If you want to change the UI language in your LINE channel, such as the "Live Agent" button, you should go to the **Webchat Widget** channel.

Go to **Channels** and find the **Webchat Widget** channel. Modify the language to Chinese in the **Basic Settings**. This will then change the language of the UI in your LINE chat.
