Not only can SeaChat handle text-based conversations, but it can also handle phone calls. The SeaChat allows you to create a voice-based conversational agent to pick up all the inbound calls for you. This voice agent can handle inbound calls, answer customer queries, and provide customer support. The SeaChat voice agent can also transfer calls to live agents when needed. In the following sections, we will show you how easy it is to set up the SeaChat voice agent and how you can test your agent with actual calls.

## Setting up the SeaChat Voice Agent

First, we need a new agent that can handle voice calls. To create a new voice agent, click on the agent dropdown menu next to your avatar. You can see the list of agents that you have created. Click on the **Add New Agent** button to create a new agent. 

In my agent description, I made sure to include that this agent is for voice calls. This way, I can easily identify which agent is for voice calls and which agent is for text-based conversations.

Once we have created our voice agent, let's start setting up the voice agent to inbound calls. Find *Inbound Calls* in **Channel** under **Agent Configuration**.

### Toll-Free Number

In the **Inbound Calls** channel, we need to first purchase a toll-free phone number. Choose the country where you want to purchase the toll-free number and phone number. Once you have chosen the desirable configuration,  click on the **Confirm Purchase** button.

*Purchase a toll-free number*
</center>

Once purchased, you can see the toll-free number of your choice. You can always release the number and purchase a new one if you are not satisfied with the number.

### Agent Configuration

After purchasing the toll-free number, we need to configure the agent to handle the inbound calls. In the **Configure Voice Agent** section, you can set up the voice agent to handle the inbound calls. 

You are welcome to enable the live agent feature for your voice agent just like any other SeaChat agent. Please make sure you have a real-human agent that will monitor and respond to the user when the live agent feature is enabled.

*Voice agent configuration*
</center>

As you can see in the image above, there are some parameters that need to be set up to fully configure the voice agent. If you are not sure about the configuration, you can start from choosing the language and SeaChat will automatically set up the rest of the configuration for you. As you can see in the image below, I have chosen the English language with SeaVoice-2 model for my voice agent. Now click on **Save Configuration** to consolidate your settings.

## Testing the Voice Agent

Now that we have set up the voice agent, we can start testing our agent to see if it can handle the inbound calls. 

<br/>
<center>
  <a href="/images/product-updates/seachat/en/channels/voicebot/configuration-done.png" style="height: 200px; width: 100%; height: 100%;display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; overflow: hidden;" target="_blank">
<img width="80%" style="border-radius: 0.4rem; cursor: zoom-in;" src="/images/product-updates/seachat/en/channels/voicebot/configuration-done.png" alt="">
</a>

*Configuration set up*
</center>

### Call the Toll-Free Number

There are two ways to test the voice agent. You can call the toll-free number that you have purchased to see how does the voice agent handle the inbound calls, or provide a number for your voice agent to dial to. Since the two methods might require different configuration in agent setting, choose the method that suits you the best.

<img width="80%" style="border-radius: 0.4rem; cursor: zoom-in;" src="/images/product-updates/seachat/en/channels/voicebot/test-agent.png" alt="">
</a>

*Test you agent*
</center>

That's it. Now, you have set up the SeaChat voice agent to handle inbound calls. You can now test your agent with actual calls and see how well your voice agent can handle the inbound calls.
