According to your subscription plan, you can upload files up to a certain size. If you exceed the file size limit, you will receive an error message.

To understand the specific features in different plans, please refer to the [Pricing and Plans](https://wiki.seasalt.ai/seachat/seachat-payments/pricing-plans/).

The file size rule for each plan are as follows:

- **Free** - Knowledge base includes up to 10 documents (200KB max) and 200k tokens
- **Standard** - Knowledge base includes up to 100 documents (1 MB max) and 1 million tokens
- **Premium** - Knowledge base includes up to 500 documents (10 MB max) and 5 million tokens

### How to check your tokens

Once a document is uploaded to the knowledge base, the document is tokenized and the tokens are deducted from your account. You can check the number of tokens used by navigating to the **Knowledge Base** dashboard in the sidebar menu. Each document uploaded to the knowledge base will show the number of tokens used.

> For 4o models, each spreadsheet row is 8K tokens, and each row is 2K tokens for 3.5 models.
