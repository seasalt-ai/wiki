## Overview
This tutorial takes a deep dive into the different features to add information to your knowledge-based agent. We will guide you through every single step of the feature, and we will also highlight some key takeaways along the way.

## Prerequisites
By now, you should already have a SeaChat agent ready to receive new knowledge. If you have not created an agent, we kindly advise you to refer to our comprehensive ``tutorial on [how to create an agent](/en/seachat/seachat-intro/02-how-to-create/).
