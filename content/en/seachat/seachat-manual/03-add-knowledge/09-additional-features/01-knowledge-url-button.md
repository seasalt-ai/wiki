# Overview

You can also include relevant reference URLs in the AI assistant's responses, allowing users to access more detailed content or play related videos. In the **Existing Knowledge** page, you can find relevant knowledge and add reference URLs to enrich the AI agent's responses. This feature enhances the user experience by providing additional information and resources to users when they are looking for some specific information.

## [Additional Settings in Knowledge Base](#additional-setting-ui)

Find **Write a New KB Document** under **Knowledge Base** and click on it. You will be directed to the dashboard of **Knowledge Base** in the **Manual Entry**. For adding a URL to ONE specific answer, manual entry allows us to upload one piece of information at a time and adjust the settings accordingly.

Make sure to provide a clear **Document Title** for the agent to retrieve the knowledge easily. Additionally, carefully describe the information to your agent in the **Document Text**. Your description will help the agent to form a response based on the information you provide.

## [Buttons](#additional-setting-ui)

The URL you provide here will be displayed as a button in the chat window. When the user clicks on the button, they will be redirected to the URL you have provided. Put the label that you wish to show your user in the **Title** and provide the URL in the **Content** field. You can add as many buttons as you want to the answer by simply clicking on the Plus(Add) sign.

## Add URL to the Answer

Now, let's test out the URL button in the chat window. When the user asks a question that matches the answer you have added the URL to, the AI agent will display the answer with the URL button. The user can click on the button to access the URL and get more detailed information. As simple as that!

<div id="additional-setting-ui" style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
<div style="width: 100%; text-align: center; display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; justify-item: center">
