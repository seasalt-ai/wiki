## Overview
SeaChat provides four methods to upload files to your agent. We will focus on the "Upload Spreadsheet" method in this tutorial and by the end of the tutorial your SeaChat agent will have a customized knowledge base at your service.


## Step 1: Create a SeaChat Agent
If you don't have a SeaChat account yet, you can sign up for free at [SeaChat website](https://chat.seasalt.ai/)! You can find all the information you need to create a knowledge-based chatbot in [Create an Agent](/en/seachat/seachat-intro/02-how-to-create/).


## Step 2: Open Knowledge Base
Find your agent's knowledge base by navigating to the "Knowledge Base" dashboard under "Agent Configuration" in the sidebar menu. By choosing "Upload Spreadsheet", you can upload a .csv or .xlsx file to your agent.

## Step 3: Upload File
By clicking on the upload button, you can submit to your agent choosing from various file formats[^1]. The file will be processed and the knowledge base will be updated accordingly once submitted.
[^1]: SeaChat supports .csv, .xls, .xlsx, .xlsm, .xlsb, .odf, .ods and .odt files.

> Before uploading the file, check if the files meet the two following requirements:
> - Table must be headers in the first row.
> - The content in any row may not exceed 2000 tokens.
> 
> Check the "Upload Guidelines" for more information.

## Step 4: Before Submission
SeaChat allows users to upload in bulk. You can see the status of each uploading file in the section below the drag-and-drop zone.

Scroll further down for the dedicated preview window that will list the first 10 rows of your spreadsheet. Once you have included all the files to be uploaded, you can upload them by clicking on the “Next” button.

## Step 5: Submit to Existing Knowledge Base
Voilà! You have successfully customized your chatbot agent with new knowledge. To view the files uploaded, you can navigate to the "Existing" section in the top-right corner of the page, where you can find the uploaded data waiting for you in the "Files" section.

## Step 6: Review your Knowledge Base
Click on the file you just uploaded to review the content. That's it! You have successfully uploaded a spreadsheet to your SeaChat agent. You can now use the knowledge base to test your agent. SeaChat provides additional settings to customize your knowledge base, we will continue to explore these features in the next part of the tutorial.
