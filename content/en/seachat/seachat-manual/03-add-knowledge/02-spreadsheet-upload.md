## Overview
SeaChat provides two methods to upload files to your agent. The first method is dedicated to CSV, JSON, or Excel files, and the second provides upload support for more than 20 types of file formats. We will focus on the first method in this tutorial.

## Step 0: Create a SeaChat Agent
If you don't have a SeaChat account yet, you can sign up for free at [SeaChat website](https://chat.seasalt.ai/)! You can find all the information you need to create a knowledge-based chatbot in [Create an Agent](/en/seachat/seachat-intro/02-how-to-create/).

## Step 1: Open Knowledge Base
Find your agent's knowledge base by navigating to the "Knowledge Base" dashboard under "Agent Configuration" in the sidebar menu. By choosing "Upload from Template File", you can upload a CSV or JSON file to your agent.

## Step 2: Upload File
By clicking on the upload button, you can submit CSV, JSON, or Excel files to your agent. The file will be processed and the knowledge base will be updated accordingly once submitted.

SeaChat also provides sample files for you to download and use as a template. By clicking on "Download CSV Template" or "Download JSON Template", you can download the sample files to your local device. You can then fill in the template with your own data and upload it to your agent.

JSON File Example:
```json
 {"id": "kb-1", "title": "Sample KB Doc", "text": "This is an example of a KB document.", "custom": {"sample_key": "sample value"}, "actions": {"references": [{"title": "Seasalt.ai", "url": "https://seasalt.ai"}, {"title": "SeaChat", "url": "https://chat.seasalt.ai/"}], "reminder": "This is some reminder text!", "capture": ["Email", "Phone Number"], "live_agent_transfer": false}}
```

CSV File Example:

| id  | title         | text                            | references            | reminder               | capture          | transfer | key         |
|-----|---------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|------------------|----------|-------------|
| kb-1| Sample KB Doc | This is an example of a KB doc. | **References Example* | This is reminder text! | Email, Phone No. | No       | sample value |
###### **References Example*: 
```json
 [{"title":"Seasalt.ai","url":"https://seasalt.ai"}, {"title":"SeaChat","url":"https://chat.seasalt.ai"}]
```

## Step 3: Before Submission
SeaChat allows users to upload in bulk. You can see the status of each uploading file in the section below the drag-and-drop zone. Make Sure to check the file format and the content before submission.

## Step 4: Submit to Existing Knowledge Base
Once you are sure of the files included, you can submit the file to upload by clicking on the "Submit" button. Voil√†! You have successfully customized your agent with new knowledge. To view the files uploaded, you can navigate to the "Existing" section in the top-right corner of the page, where you can find the uploaded data in the "Files" section.
