## [Additional Settings in Knowledge Base](#additional-setting-ui)

Find **Write a New KB Document** under **Knowledge Base** and click on it. You will be directed to the dashboard of **Knowledge Base** in the **Manual Entry**. You can choose any uploading methods and add url to the agent's answer, we will use the method of manual entry to demonstrate how to add URL to the agent's answer.

Make sure to provide a clear **Document Title** for the agent to retrieve the knowledge easily. Additionally, carefully describe the information to your agent in the **Document Text**. Your description will help the agent to form a response based on the information you provide.

## [Buttons](#additional-setting-ui)

The URL you provide here will be displayed as a button in the chat window. When the user clicks on the button, they will be redirected to the URL you have provided. Put the label that you wish to show your user in the **Title** and provide the URL in the **Content** field. You can add as many buttons as you want to the answer by simply clicking on the Plus(Add) sign.

## Add URL to the Answer

The user can click on the button to access the URL and get more detailed information. As simple as that!
