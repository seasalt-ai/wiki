## Overview
SeaChat provides four methods to upload files to your agent. We will focus on the **Transcribe Audio/Video** method in this tutorial and by the end of the tutorial your SeaChat agent will have a customized knowledge base at your service.


## Create a SeaChat Agent
If you don't have a SeaChat account yet, you can sign up for free at [SeaChat website](https://chat.seasalt.ai/)! You can find all the information you need to create a knowledge-based chatbot in [Create an Agent](/en/seachat/seachat-intro/02-how-to-create/).


## Open Knowledge Base
Find your agent's knowledge base by navigating to the **Knowledge Base** dashboard under **Agent Configuration** in the sidebar menu. By choosing **Transcribe Audio/Video**, you can upload a video or audio file to your agent.

## Upload File
By clicking on the upload button, you can submit to your agent choosing from various file formats[^1]. The file will be processed and the knowledge base will be updated accordingly once submitted.
