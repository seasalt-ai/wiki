## Support Plan

For customers with complex usage scenarios, we recommend subscribing to our **Launch Support Plan**. Deploying an LLM-powered AI agent requires extensive in-domain knowledge, technical support, and careful design decisions. The SeaChat team has observed many failed deployments due to a lack of understanding of how LLMs and RAG function. Additionally, voice applications are subject to strict regulations from telecom authorities and the FCC.
