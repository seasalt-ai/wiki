5. (Optional) Please disconnect any other chatbot services, like Shopify Inbox, to prevent confusion. For Shopify app users, disable the "Apps embeds" toggle on your website customization page. If your previous chatbot service is embedded in code, remove it carefully. Need assistance? Contact us at seachat@seaslt.ai.
