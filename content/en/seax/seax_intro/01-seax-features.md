## Advanced Features
-------------------

The SeaX Collaborative Contact Center also has a number of advanced features that you can add to power up your contact center.

### SeaX Virtual Agent

The SeaX Virtual Agent is a chat and voice bot that can handle a wide range of basic questions about your business, addressing topics such as:

* location
* hours
* contact information
* amenities
* menu

For more complex questions that the agent cannot answer, the SeaX interface allows customers to request a **live agent**, or a human customer service representative available within the SeaX Collaborative Contact Center.

### AI Knowledge Base

The AI Knowledge Base automatically searches your knowledge base about your business to give your agents the information they need in real time while talking to your customers.

### Auto Dialer

SeaX has two avaiable auto dialers: the Message Drop Dialer and the Progressive Dialer.

#### Message Drop Dialer

The Message Drop Dialer allows you to quickly deliver messages to your customers over the phone by automatically dialing and playing a message when the call is picked up.

#### Progressive Dialer

The Progressive Dialer helps your agents make outbound calls by automatically dialing and leaving voicemails, only passing the call through to the agent when a person picks up the phone.
