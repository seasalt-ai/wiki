## SeaX Features
-------------------

The **SeaX Virtual Agent** can handle a wide range of basic questions about your business, addressing topics such as:

* location
* hours
* contact information
* amenities
* menu

For more complex questions that the agent cannot answer, the SeaX interface allows customers to request a **live agent**, or a human customer service representative available within the SeaX Collaborative Contact Center.
