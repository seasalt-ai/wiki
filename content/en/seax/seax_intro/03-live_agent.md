Although SeaX Virtual Agent can handle a wide range of basic questions automatically, customers often request to speak to live agents for more complex questions that SeaX Virtual Agent cannot answer. The SeaX interface allows customers to request a **live agent**, or a human customer service representative available within the SeaX Collaborative Contact Center.
