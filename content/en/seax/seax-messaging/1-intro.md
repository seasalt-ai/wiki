## What is SeaX?

**SeaX** is an omni-channel communication platform developed by Seasalt.ai that empowers businesses to conduct **bulk outreach**, **engage in two-way messaging**, and **automate responses using AI agents** — all from a single, unified interface.

Designed with marketers, customer experience teams, and operations leaders in mind, SeaX helps organizations reach thousands of users simultaneously through **SMS**, **WhatsApp**, and **Phone Calls**, with seamless support for **AI follow-up conversations** via SeaChat. It’s a modern communication hub for organizations that need to scale customer engagement without scaling human effort.

## Key Features

SeaX focuses on **three pillars of communication** functionality across each supported channel:

### 1. Bulk Messaging and Calling

SeaX enables you to send **high-volume campaigns** across all supported channels:

* **SMS Blasts** for time-sensitive promotions, alerts, and reminders
* **WhatsApp Campaigns** with rich content (images, buttons, quick replies)
* **Voice Broadcasts** with pre-recorded or text-to-speech content

Whether you're reaching out to 100 or 100,000 contacts, SeaX is optimized for scale. You can import your contact lists, personalize message content, and track delivery metrics in real time.

### 2. Two-Way Communication

Unlike many one-directional broadcast tools, SeaX supports **interactive conversations**. Customers can **reply directly** to your message or call, and you can continue the conversation within the SeaX dashboard — either manually or using an AI assistant.

This is crucial for:

* Lead qualification after a campaign
* Customer inquiries and support follow-ups
* Interactive surveys and opt-in confirmations

Each response is logged as a **conversation thread**, making it easy to monitor, manage, and resolve interactions as they unfold.

### 3. AI Agent Support (via SeaChat)

What happens when your campaign gets thousands of replies?

SeaX integrates natively with [SeaChat](https://chat.seasalt.ai), Seasalt.ai’s no-code AI agent platform. This enables an **AI-powered agent** to step in and carry on the conversation — instantly and at scale.

For example:

> You launch a WhatsApp campaign to 10,000 customers. 2,000 people reply with questions or intent to purchase. Rather than overwhelm your team, SeaX hands those conversations off to SeaChat agents who can qualify leads, book appointments, or answer FAQs — 24/7.

You can also choose to escalate from AI to a human agent when needed, creating a smooth **AI + human hybrid** experience.

* **SMS**
  Traditional text messaging with global reach and fast delivery. Perfect for alerts, reminders, and outreach where internet connectivity isn’t guaranteed.

* **Phone Calls**
  SeaX supports both **automated voice campaigns** (using TTS or recorded messages) and **human agent dialers**. This includes:

  * **Outbound call campaigns**
  * **Inbound call handling**
  * **Click-to-call for human agents**
  * Optional AI agent support for voice interactions

Coming soon:

## Voice Dialer for Human Agents

Beyond AI automation, SeaX includes a powerful **cloud dialer** that supports **manual outbound calling** and **inbound routing** for sales and support teams.

Agents can:

* Receive inbound calls routed from IVRs or campaigns
* Click to call from lead lists or CRM
* Record and tag calls for training and analytics
* Collaborate with SeaChat AI agents for pre-qualification or call wrap-up

This makes SeaX suitable not only for automated outreach, but also as a lightweight, flexible alternative to traditional call center platforms.

## Use Cases

SeaX is used across a wide range of industries and campaign types:

* **Sales & Lead Generation**
  Send outbound WhatsApp or SMS campaigns and qualify leads automatically using AI.
