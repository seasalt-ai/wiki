3. **Check Number Types**: SeaX supports various number types including:
   - WhatsApp-enabled numbers

   - Standard phone numbers with SMS/MMS capabilities

### Handling Inbound Calls

#### Receiving Calls

1. You'll hear an incoming call notification
2. Click to answer the call through your browser interface
3. Use the on-screen keypad during calls if needed for IVR navigation

#### Call Management Features

- **Call Logs**: Access detailed logs of all incoming and outbound calls
- **Contact Integration**: Numbers registered in your contacts will display associated names
- **Multi-Channel Integration**: The same number can be used for both voice calls and WhatsApp messaging

### Making Outbound Calls

2. **Search Contacts**: Use the search function to find existing contacts
3. **Select Number**: Choose the appropriate number if multiple options are available

- **Default Inbound Agents**: Set whether humans or AI agents handle incoming calls by default
- **Channel-Specific Settings**: Configure different agents for SMS vs. voice calls

#### Round Robin System

When multiple agents are assigned to a number:
- Calls are distributed to available agents in round-robin fashion
- Each agent receives a 10-second ring before the call moves to the next available agent
- System prioritizes agents with "least busy" status
- If no human agents are available, calls can automatically transfer to AI agents

### Integration with Other SeaX Features

The dial pad functionality integrates seamlessly with:

### Best Practices

1. **Agent Availability**: Keep your status updated to ensure proper call routing
2. **Audio Quality**: Use quality headsets for better call experience
3. **Contact Management**: Maintain updated contact lists for efficient outbound calling
4. **AI Backup**: Configure AI agents as backup for when human agents are unavailable
5. **Call Logging**: Regularly review call logs for performance insights

### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**
- **Audio Echo**: Adjust microphone and speaker settings to prevent feedback
- **Missed Calls**: Ensure agent status is set to "Available" and audio notifications are enabled
- **Number Configuration**: Verify phone numbers are properly enabled for voice calls in the Numbers section

This dial pad feature transforms SeaX into a complete human-AI native contact center solution, allowing seamless transitions between automated campaigns and personal customer interactions.

### Understanding Round Robin

When a phone number is set to route inbound calls to human agents, SeaX applies the following ring assignment rules based on agent status:

Ringing Logic

* Only agents with Available status will be called  
* Agents are sorted by activity time to determine the ringing order  
* Each agent is tried for 10 seconds before the system moves to the next  
* In each round, agents who were already rung but didnâ€™t answer are skipped

Note: If only one agent is online and doesnâ€™t answer, the system will play a busy message to the caller and end the call.
