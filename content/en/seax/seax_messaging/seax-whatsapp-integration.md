## Test it Out!

Simply go to **Conversations** in the sidebar menu and start chatting with your customers on WhatsApp. You can now leverage the power of SeaX Messaging to engage with your customers on WhatsApp utilizing tools such as campaigns and bulk messages.

## Multiple WhatsApp Accounts

For business that have multiple Whatsapp business accounts, you will find this feature to be particularly useful as it allows you to collect all your accounts in one place. 

Traditionally, WhatsApp Business App only allows you to log into 4 devices that means only up to 4 people can chat in WhatsApp Business App. However, with SeaX Messaging, you can connect as many WhatsApp business accounts to SeaX Messaging as you want. 

You can connect them to SeaX Messaging by clicking on **Add Account** in the **WhatsApp** section of **Channels**. Follow the same steps above to connect your additional WhatsApp accounts to SeaX Messaging.
