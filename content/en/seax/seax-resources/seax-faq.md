## 3. How are "DNC" labels captured in WhatsApp?

Same as SMS, “DNC” labels are added to a recipient if they reply the following phrases: stop, cancel, end, quit, stopall, unsubscribe, remove me, stop sending me messages, wrong person and wrong number.

Additionally, WhatsApp provides a button specifically to unsubscribe from marketing messages like the following “Stop Promotions” button:

<br/>
<center>
<a style="border-radius: 0.4rem; cursor: zoom-in;" href="/images/seax/en/seax-resources/stop-promotions.jpeg" target="_blank">
<img width="80%" style="border-radius: 0.4rem" src="/images/seax/en/seax-resources/stop-promotions.jpeg" alt="Stop Promotions to capture DNC">
</a>
</center>


If a user clicks on it, then the “DNC” label will be applied to the user.

A marketer can insert this “Stop promotions” button by selecting the “Marketing opt-out” as the Quick Reply type button:

<br/>
<center>
<a style="border-radius: 0.4rem; cursor: zoom-in;" href="/images/seax/en/seax-resources/setup-stop-promotions.jpeg" target="_blank">
<img width="80%" style="border-radius: 0.4rem" src="/images/seax/en/seax-resources/setup-stop-promotions.jpeg" alt="Stop Promotions to capture DNC">
</a>
