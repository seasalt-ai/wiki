Once the bot joins, you will see the real-time meeting transcript being generated, including the speaker and speaking time. SeaMeet's transcript recognition is specially trained for the Taiwanese market and can recognize mixed Chinese and English conversation scenarios.

During the meeting, AI will automatically extract meeting summaries, action items, and discussion topics from the conversation at regular intervals.
