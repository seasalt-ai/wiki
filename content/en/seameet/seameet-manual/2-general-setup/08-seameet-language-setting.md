SeaMeet currently supports three modes: Traditional Chinese, English, and automatic language detection. You can switch the meeting record language at any time before or during the meeting.

## Switch Default Transcription Language

1. Go to the **Account** -> **Preference** page.
2. Set the default meeting recording language for your account for future invitations to the copilot. 
3. When starting a "Scheduled Meeting" recording, you will see that the default recording language has changed.
