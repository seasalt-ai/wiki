You can adjust the recipients of automatically shared meeting records in the **Common Settings** of the **Workspace Settings**.

*Common Settings*

<br/>

You can set the auto-sharing feature in the "Common Settings". Currently, SeaMeet offers three options:

1. **Share only with yourself**

    When you invite the copilot to record a meeting and the meeting ends, the system will automatically send an email to your inbox.

2. **Share with all calendar attendees**

    When you invite the copilot to transcribe a meeting and the meeting ends, the system will automatically send an email to all attendees invited via the Google Calendar.

3. **Do not automatically share with anyone (including yourself)**

    No meeting records will be sent after the meeting ends.

If you enable the auto-sharing feature, the system will automatically send the meeting record via email to the designated recipients according to your auto-sharing settings after the meeting ends.
