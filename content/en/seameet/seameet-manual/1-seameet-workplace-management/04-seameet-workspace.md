A workspace is where you manage all meetings, team members, and plans. You can create a shared workspace for your company, department, or team, allowing invited users to jointly manage all meeting records stored in this workspace.

### Manage Meetings

Meeting records will be stored in the designated workspace. You can manage future, ongoing, or completed meetings in the workspace.

### Team Collaboration

You can invite team members to join the workspace on the "Workspace Settings - Users" page to collaboratively view and edit meeting records. You can also set different permissions to better manage the workspace.

Once you send the invitation, the invited users can register and log in using the link in the invitation email and join the invited workspace.

1. User permissions are divided into "Admin" and "Member".
2. Admin
    - Can view all meetings in the workspace.
    - Can delete meetings.
    - Can invite users to the workspace and grant any permissions.
    - Can remove users.
3. Member
    - Default can view all meetings in the workspace but can be adjusted to view personal meetings only.
    - Cannot delete meetings.
    - Can invite users to the workspace but can only invite as "Member".
    - Cannot remove users.
