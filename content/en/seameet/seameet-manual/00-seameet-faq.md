## 1. **How do I start meeting transcription?**

You can invite the SeaMeet Copilot to join the meeting in Google Calendar or Google Meet. Once the meeting starts, the Copilot will automatically join and begin transcription.

## 2. **Which meeting platforms does SeaMeet support?**

Currently, SeaMeet supports transcribing meetings held in Google Meet. More meeting platforms will be supported in the future.

## 3. **Which languages does SeaMeet support?**

SeaMeet currently supports transcribing meetings in Chinese and English. Support for additional languages will be expanded gradually.

## 4. **Can I collaborate with my team members?**

Absolutely. Simply invite your team members to your workspace, and they will be able to see all meetings in the shared workspace and collaboratively edit meeting records.

## 5. **What is a workspace?**

A workspace is where you manage all your meetings, team members, and plans.

### **5-1. How do I manage meetings in the workspace?**

Any transcribed meeting records will be stored in the workspace. You can manage future, ongoing, and completed meetings in the workspace.

### **5-2. How do I collaborate with my team in the workspace?**

You can invite team members to join the workspace to collaboratively view and edit meeting records. You can also set different permissions for better management of the workspace.

### **5-3. How do I choose a plan?**

If you want more transcription hours or advanced features, feel free to **upgrade your workspace plan** or **contact our customer service at seameet@seasalt.ai**. We will be happy to assist you.

## 6. **How do I log in to SeaMeet?**

You can log in to SeaMeet using your Google account or register using your email.

## 7. **Can I edit already recorded transcripts?**

You can use the export to Google Docs feature to edit. Editing is currently not allowed on the SeaMeet meeting page, but this feature is expected to be supported soon.

## 8. **Can I download meeting audio files?**

Downloading meeting audio files is currently not allowed.

## 9. **Does SeaMeet support in-person meetings? Can I change the speaker?**

You can use a computer to open Google Meet for meeting recording during in-person meetings. However, features like changing the speaker for in-person meetings are not yet available and are expected to be provided in Q1 2024.

## 10. **If I have multiple workspaces, can I store meetings in different workspaces separately? Can I switch languages?**

If the meeting is scheduled in Google Calendar, the storage location and language will be determined according to the default language and default workspace in "Personal Settings - Meeting Settings". If you use the Chrome application to invite, you can specify which workspace to store it in.

## 11. **Why does SeaMeet Copilot still join the meeting even after I've turned off the auto-join feature?**

First, please disconnect your Google Calendar in order to stop SeaMeet Copilot from synchronizing with your Google Calendar. Go to **Account** -> **Integration** to disconnect Google Calendar.

If after disconnecting, SeaMeet Copilot still joins the meeting, it is because the meeting was scheduled before the disconnection. In this case, you can manually remove the meeting from your meeting list. Go to **Meeting List** and find the future meetings with the turquoise background. Simply click on the trash can icon to delete the meeting.

## 12. **As a registered user, can I invite the copilot back to the meeting if the copilot leaves the meeting?**

Yes, you can invite the copilot back to the meeting. You can go to your meeting list and click on **Start Recording** to invite the copilot back to the meeting.

## 13. **If I use an unregistered account, will the registered user be able to see the meeting records?**

If the registered user has invited the copilot to the meeting, then the registered user will be able to see the meeting records. Moreover, if the registered user has scheduled the meeting in the meeting list, they can use the auto-share feature to share the meeting records with everyone that is invited to that meeting. Simply go to **General** -> **Auto Share** and choose **All participants in calendar event**. You can take a look at our [tutorial](https://wiki.seasalt.ai/en/seameet/sharing/) for more information.

## 14. **Will the registered user be able to receive the meeting transcription if they join a meeting scheduled by other users?**

If the registered user invites the copilot to the meeting, then the registered user will be able to receive the meeting transcription. If the registered user has not invited the copilot to the meeting, then they will not be able to receive the meeting transcription. However, if the meeting owner has enabled the auto-share feature, the meeting transcription will be shared with everyone that is invited to the meeting.

## 15. **Where can I see the email that I have set up for auto-sharing?**

Go to **Workspace** -> **General** -> **Auto Share**. You can see the email that you have set up for auto-sharing in the **Auto Share** section.

## 16. **Do I need to confirm the invitation email for the copilot to join the meeting?**

No, as long as you have invited the copilot to the meeting, and you have enough base minutes left, the copilot will automatically join the meeting.

## 17. **Do I have to use Google Calendar to invite the copilot to the meeting?**

Not necessarily. SeaMeet provides multiple ways to invite the copilot to the meeting. You can find more information in our [tutorial](https://wiki.seasalt.ai/seameet/seameet-manual/01-seameet-intro/).

## 18. **If a registered user hosts more than one meeting at the same time, will the copilot be able to join all the meetings?**

No, only users with team plans can host multiple meetings at the same time. If you are using an individual plan, you can only host one meeting at a time. The number of available copilots depends on the number of paid licenses. That is, if there are two paid licenses, you can invite two copilots to join the meetings.

## 19. **How long does a meeting stay in the meeting list? How can we know which meeting in the meeting list lasted the longest?**

Currently, meetings do not have an expiration date. You can see the meeting duration of each meeting in the meeting list.

## 20. **How much would I pay if I use more than the 50 hours of base minutes? Does the system notify the user when the base minutes are running out?**

After you exceed the 50 hours of base minutes, you will be charged $1 per hour. You can always check the remaining base minutes and the minutes used at the bottom of your sidebar.

## 21. **Will the copilot quit the recording if the base minutes run out?**

Currently, there are only two situations that will cause the copilot to quit the recording. One is when a user with the free plan uses more than six hours in total, and the other is when a single meeting exceeds the limits of certain hours. For free plan users, the limit is one hour. For paid plan individual users, the limit is three hours, and for paid plan team users, the limit is five hours.

## 22. What if the language used in the meeting has more than one language. For example, a meeting in English and Chinese. How should I set the meeting language?

Although one can set the meeting language to **Detect Language**, we recommand users to set the meeting language to the primary language used in the meeting for optimal performance. One way to do deal with multiple languages is to set the meeting language to the primary language used in the meeting and switch to the other language mid-meeting when the conversation will be conducted in that language. The transcription will then have both the primary language and the other language.

## 23. Can I also record the video of the meeting? 

No, SeaMeet currently only supports transcribing and recording the audio of the meeting. Video recording is not supported at the moment.

## 24. Can I download the meeting recording?

Yes, user with paid plans can download the meeting recording. Free plan user can only listen to the recording on the SeaMeet platform.

## 25. Can SeaMeet discern between different speakers in a physical meeting?

This feature is not yet available. However, we expect to provide an alternative feature by the end of 2024. Users can use one single resource of recording device to record a physical meeting and SeaMeet will identify the speakers based on the audio, and then user can manually change the speaker names in the transcription. 

## 26. The copilot joined the meeting but accidentally left. If SeaMeet cannot automatically rejoin the meeting, how can I invite it again using a mobile device?

You can invite the SeaMeet copilot to join the meeting again using a mobile device in the following two scenarios:

1. **For meetings that have not yet had the copilot record**: You can invite `meet@seasalt.ai` to the meeting through Google Calendar, ensuring that the copilot joins the meeting on time to start recording.

2. **For meetings where the copilot has already been invited**: Simply log in to SeaMeet on your mobile device -> go to the meeting list page -> click on "Start Meeting" -> and paste the Google Meet ID to invite the copilot to rejoin the meeting.

> **Note**
>
> To invite SeaMeet to record the same meeting again, make sure that the "previous SeaMeet meeting record" has ended. If the meeting was previously being recorded by SeaMeet, it may take about 30 seconds to a minute to process after stopping the meeting.
>
> Be sure to wait until the previous recording has completely ended before making the second invitation, as otherwise, the system might determine that "the meeting is already being recorded," resulting in an invitation failure.

## 27. How can I use only the hours from the team workspace to automatically join meetings, instead of using the hours from my personal workspace?

Currently, SeaMeet determines which plan's hours are deducted, **based on the workspace where the meeting is stored**.
So, if you want the feature of "automatically joined meetings" to use the team plan's hours and store the meeting records in the team workspace, you can set the default workspace to the team workspace by following this path: **Account** -> **Meeting Preference** -> **Default Settings** -> **Default Workspace**.

## 28. What is the difference between the SeaMeet individual plan and the team plan?

Here are the main differences between the two plans:

1. The team plan allows multiple people to collaborate in the workspace, where everyone can view transcriptions in the backend, download audio, and export using Google Docs, etc.
2. The team plan supports multiple simultaneous meetings, whereas the individual plan allows only one copilot to join a meeting at a time. For individual plan users, if the copilot is still attending Meeting A and the user starts another Meeting B, the copilot will not be able to join Meeting B.

## 29. Why wasn't my meeting fully recorded?
There are various reasons why a meeting might not be fully recorded. Please first check if the bot was admitted into the meeting by the host and successfully joined the meeting room. If so, confirm whether the bot stayed throughout the entire meeting or was removed by a participant at some point.

If the bot remained in the meeting room the entire time, please verify whether the recording and transcript are complete. Then send the SeaMeet meeting record link along with your issue description to <email: seameet@seasalt.ai> for further assistance.

## 30. The bot can’t join and keeps spinning
Please ask the Google Meet meeting host to check whether the bot's join request was received.
If not, go to the SeaMeet meeting list to confirm whether the meeting was successfully created.

## 31. Why does my meeting audio file show “File Not Found”?
It may still be processing within five minutes after the meeting ends. If the file is still missing after ten minutes, please send the SeaMeet meeting record link to <email: seameet@seasalt.ai> for further investigation.

## 32. Why can’t I download the meeting audio?
Audio downloads are currently only available for "Personal" and "Team" plan users. Free plan users do not have access to downloads yet.

## 33. How do I record bilingual meetings in Chinese and English?
To conduct a bilingual meeting, we recommend selecting “Traditional Chinese” as the transcription language. It can simultaneously recognize English speech.

## 34. How is SeaMeet bot usage time calculated?
SeaMeet only starts counting recording time after the bot successfully joins the Google Meet room. If the bot does not enter the meeting, no time is counted.
Binding your Google Calendar allows the bot to automatically attempt to join meetings, but time is not recorded unless the bot is admitted and records content.

For paid plans, the usage time resets every month, allowing the full monthly quota for transcription.

## 35. Can someone other than the meeting host invite the SeaMeet bot?
Yes, anyone can invite the bot, but the meeting host must approve the bot’s entry.
The recording will be associated with the account that invited the bot and time usage will be calculated accordingly.

If the meeting host is not a SeaMeet user, they cannot invite the bot on your behalf unless they have a SeaMeet account.

## 36. What happens after exceeding the monthly usage limit?
Each plan includes a monthly quota. Once exceeded, additional usage will incur extra charges, but recordings can continue.

## 37. After the meeting ends, has the “View full meeting record” link in the summary email changed from Google Docs to the SeaMeet site?
Yes, to provide a better experience for recipients, we’ve redesigned this.

Workspace users who click the link will be taken to the “SeaMeet meeting page.”

Non-workspace users will see the “SeaMeet public share page,” which is view-only and cannot be edited.

If the recipient hasn’t been invited or granted access, the content will be masked for security.

## 38. Where can I manage permissions for shared meeting pages?
Each meeting has its own “Share List.”
Click the Share button in the top-right corner of the meeting page to edit the share list or review access requests.
If sharing is set to “Invite calendar attendees,” they will be automatically added to the view list.

## 39. How do I subscribe to an annual plan?
The annual plan option is currently under development.
If you need one now, please contact us at <email: seameet@seasalt.ai> and we’ll set it up manually.

## 40. Why does my subscription only last until the end of this month? Why am I not charged $9.99/month?
SeaMeet Personal Plan is billed monthly at $9.99, from the 1st to the end of each month.
If you subscribe mid-month, a prorated charge will apply (e.g., subscribe on 4/20, you pay 1/3 of $9.99 for the remaining days).

## 1. Will adding admins or members increase the cost?
Yes. In the Team Plan, each additional seat incurs a charge, which will be billed at the start of the next month.

## 42. Why can’t I remove my credit card directly?
To prevent overdue charges for items like additional usage or new members, credit cards cannot be removed directly while a subscription is active.
If you no longer need the service, we can help remove the card manually.

If you prefer not to store a card, consider one-time payment options such as an annual plan with 12-month prepayment via bank transfer.

## 43. Can you help improve recognition for commonly used company-specific terms?
Yes! Please provide a glossary of commonly misrecognized terms so we can help improve accuracy.

## 44. Does SeaMeet support Microsoft Teams?
Microsoft Teams support is currently in internal testing and not yet available to general users.
Public availability is planned for Q2 2025. At that time, you’ll be able to paste the meeting link to invite SeaMeet bot.

## 45. How do I change my login password?
SeaMeet primarily uses Google login or OTP-based login. Password login is reserved for enterprise clients and currently cannot be edited directly by users.

## 46. Can I delete my account or workspace?
SeaMeet does not yet offer self-serve account or workspace deletion.
To ensure the bot won’t auto-join meetings, you can disconnect your Google Calendar.
If you need to delete a workspace, please email <email: seameet@seasalt.ai>.
⚠️ Note: Deleted workspaces cannot be recovered.

## 47. Is SeaMeet secure?
Yes — data security is our top priority when recording meetings.
See our [Terms of Service](https://seasalt.ai/terms/) for details on our usage terms and security practices.
For info on what data we collect and how we use it, see our [Privacy Policy](https://seasalt.ai/privacy/).
We use WAF protection via Azure and AWS to prevent malicious access, and FIPS-compliant encryption to protect sensitive data.
SeaMeet complies with CASA Level 2 security, performs regular Nessus vulnerability scans, and meets HECVAT standards and US data residency guarantees.

## 48. Can the bot auto-join meetings without host approval?
No — due to privacy and security concerns (especially for external meetings), host approval is required before the bot can join.

If you're unsure why a bot failed to join, please check this guide.

## 49. Can the bot’s display name be changed?
Currently, there are no plans to support customizing the bot’s nickname.

## 50. Can the bot be muted to not speak during meetings?
Due to security policy constraints, this feature is not currently supported.

## 51. How do I disable the SeaMeet popup in every Google Meet session?
The SeaMeet popup is a feature of the Chrome extension.
To disable it, click the extension icon in the upper-right corner of Chrome and choose Manage Extensions to adjust the settings.
