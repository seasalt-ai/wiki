## 1. **How do I start meeting transcription?**

You can invite the SeaMeet Copilot to join the meeting in Google Calendar or Google Meet. Once the meeting starts, the Copilot will automatically join and begin transcription.

## 2. **Which meeting platforms does SeaMeet support?**

Currently, SeaMeet supports transcribing meetings held in Google Meet. More meeting platforms will be supported in the future.

SeaMeet currently supports transcribing meetings in Chinese and English. Support for additional languages will be expanded gradually.

## 4. **Can I collaborate with my team members?**

Absolutely. Simply invite your team members to your workspace, and they will be able to see all meetings in the shared workspace and collaboratively edit meeting records.

## 5. **What is a workspace?**

A workspace is where you manage all your meetings, team members, and plans.

### **5-1. How do I manage meetings in the workspace?**

Any transcribed meeting records will be stored in the workspace. You can manage future, ongoing, and completed meetings in the workspace.

### **5-2. How do I collaborate with my team in the workspace?**

You can invite team members to join the workspace to collaboratively view and edit meeting records. You can also set different permissions for better management of the workspace.

### **5-3. How do I choose a plan?**

If you want more transcription hours or advanced features, feel free to **upgrade your workspace plan** or **contact our customer service at seameet@seasalt.ai**. We will be happy to assist you.

## 6. **How do I log in to SeaMeet?**

You can log in to SeaMeet using your Google account or register using your email.

## 7. **Can I edit already recorded transcripts?**

You can use the export to Google Docs feature to edit. Editing is currently not allowed on the SeaMeet meeting page, but this feature is expected to be supported soon.

## 8. **Can I download meeting audio files?**

Downloading meeting audio files is currently not allowed.

## 9. **Does SeaMeet support in-person meetings? Can I change the speaker?**

You can use a computer to open Google Meet for meeting recording during in-person meetings. However, features like changing the speaker for in-person meetings are not yet available and are expected to be provided in Q1 2024.

## 10. **If I have multiple workspaces, can I store meetings in different workspaces separately? Can I switch languages?**

If the meeting is scheduled in Google Calendar, the storage location and language will be determined according to the default language and default workspace in "Personal Settings - Meeting Settings". If you use the Chrome application to invite, you can specify which workspace to store it in.

## 11. **Why does SeaMeet Copilot still join the meeting even after I've turned off the auto-join feature?**

First, please disconnect your Google Calendar in order to stop SeaMeet Copilot from synchronizing with your Google Calendar. Go to **Account** -> **Integration** to disconnect Google Calendar.

If after disconnecting, SeaMeet Copilot still joins the meeting, it is because the meeting was scheduled before the disconnection. In this case, you can manually remove the meeting from your meeting list. Go to **Meeting List** and find the future meetings with the turquoise background. Simply click on the trash can icon to delete the meeting.

## 12. **As a registered user, can I invite the copilot back to the meeting if the copilot leaves the meeting?**

Yes, you can invite the copilot back to the meeting. You can go to your meeting list and click on **Start Recording** to invite the copilot back to the meeting.

## 13. **If I use an unregistered account, will the registered user be able to see the meeting records?**

If the registered user has invited the copilot to the meeting, then the registered user will be able to see the meeting records. Moreover, if the registered user has scheduled the meeting in the meeting list, they can use the auto-share feature to share the meeting records with everyone that is invited to that meeting. Simply go to **General** -> **Auto Share** and choose **All participants in calendar event**. You can take a look at our [tutorial](https://wiki.seasalt.ai/seameet/seameet-manual/2-general-setup/10-seameet-sharing/) for more information.

## 14. **Will the registered user be able to receive the meeting transcription if they join a meeting scheduled by other users?**

If the registered user invites the copilot to the meeting, then the registered user will be able to receive the meeting transcription. If the registered user has not invited the copilot to the meeting, then they will not be able to receive the meeting transcription. However, if the meeting owner has enabled the auto-share feature, the meeting transcription will be shared with everyone that is invited to the meeting.

## 15. **Where can I see the email that I have set up for auto-sharing?**

Go to **Workspace** -> **General** -> **Auto Share**. You can see the email that you have set up for auto-sharing in the **Auto Share** section.

## 16. **Do I need to confirm the invitation email for the copilot to join the meeting?**

No, as long as you have invited the copilot to the meeting, and you have enough base minutes left, the copilot will automatically join the meeting.

## 17. **Do I have to use Google Calendar to invite the copilot to the meeting?**

Not necessarily. SeaMeet provides multiple ways to invite the copilot to the meeting. You can find more information in our [tutorial](https://wiki.seasalt.ai/seameet/seameet-manual/01-seameet-intro/).

## 18. **If a registered user hosts more than one meeting at the same time, will the copilot be able to join all the meetings?**

No, only users with team plans can host multiple meetings at the same time. If you are using an individual plan, you can only host one meeting at a time. The number of available copilots depends on the number of paid licenses. That is, if there are two paid licenses, you can invite two copilots to join the meetings.

## 19. **How long does a meeting stay in the meeting list? How can we know which meeting in the meeting list lasted the longest?**

Currently, meetings do not have an expiration date. You can see the meeting duration of each meeting in the meeting list.

## 20. **How much would I pay if I use more than the 50 hours of base minutes? Does the system notify the user when the base minutes are running out?**

After you exceed the 50 hours of base minutes, you will be charged $1 per hour. You can always check the remaining base minutes and the minutes used at the bottom of your sidebar.

## 21. **Will the copilot quit the recording if the base minutes run out?**

Currently, there are only two situations that will cause the copilot to quit the recording. One is when a user with the free plan uses more than six hours in total, and the other is when a single meeting exceeds the limits of certain hours. For free plan users, the limit is one hour. For paid plan individual users, the limit is three hours, and for paid plan team users, the limit is five hours.

## 22. What if the language used in the meeting has more than one language. For example, a meeting in English and Chinese. How should I set the meeting language?

Although one can set the meeting language to **Detect Language**, we recommand users to set the meeting language to the primary language used in the meeting for optimal performance. One way to do deal with multiple languages is to set the meeting language to the primary language used in the meeting and switch to the other language mid-meeting when the conversation will be conducted in that language. The transcription will then have both the primary language and the other language.

## 23. Can I also record the video of the meeting? 

No, SeaMeet currently only supports transcribing and recording the audio of the meeting. Video recording is not supported at the moment.

## 24. Can I download the meeting recording?

Yes, user with paid plans can download the meeting recording. Free plan user can only listen to the recording on the SeaMeet platform.

## 25. Can SeaMeet discern between different speakers in a physical meeting?

This feature is not yet available. However, we expect to provide an alternative feature by the end of 2024. Users can use one single resource of recording device to record a physical meeting and SeaMeet will identify the speakers based on the audio, and then user can manually change the speaker names in the transcription. 

## 26. The copilot joined the meeting but accidentally left. If SeaMeet cannot automatically rejoin the meeting, how can I invite it again using a mobile device?

You can invite the SeaMeet copilot to join the meeting again using a mobile device in the following two scenarios:

1. **For meetings that have not yet had the copilot record**: You can invite `meet@seasalt.ai` to the meeting through Google Calendar, ensuring that the copilot joins the meeting on time to start recording.

2. **For meetings where the copilot has already been invited**: Simply log in to SeaMeet on your mobile device -> go to the meeting list page -> click on "Start Meeting" -> and paste the Google Meet ID to invite the copilot to rejoin the meeting.

> **Note**
>
> To invite SeaMeet to record the same meeting again, make sure that the "previous SeaMeet meeting record" has ended. If the meeting was previously being recorded by SeaMeet, it may take about 30 seconds to a minute to process after stopping the meeting.
>
> Be sure to wait until the previous recording has completely ended before making the second invitation, as otherwise, the system might determine that "the meeting is already being recorded," resulting in an invitation failure.
