## 1. **How do I start meeting transcription?**

You can invite the SeaMeet Copilot to join the meeting in Google Calendar or Google Meet. Once the meeting starts, the Copilot will automatically join and begin transcription.

## 2. **Which meeting platforms does SeaMeet support?**

Currently, SeaMeet supports transcribing meetings held in Google Meet. More meeting platforms will be supported in the future.

## 3. **Which languages does SeaMeet support?**

SeaMeet currently supports transcribing meetings in Chinese and English. Support for additional languages will be expanded gradually.

## 4. **Can I collaborate with my team members?**

Absolutely. Simply invite your team members to your workspace, and they will be able to see all meetings in the shared workspace and collaboratively edit meeting records.

## 5. **What is a workspace?**

A workspace is where you manage all your meetings, team members, and plans.

### **5-1. How do I manage meetings in the workspace?**

Any transcribed meeting records will be stored in the workspace. You can manage future, ongoing, and completed meetings in the workspace.

### **5-2. How do I collaborate with my team in the workspace?**

You can invite team members to join the workspace to collaboratively view and edit meeting records. You can also set different permissions for better management of the workspace.

### **5-3. How do I choose a plan?**

If you want more transcription hours or advanced features, feel free to **upgrade your workspace plan** or **contact our customer service <email: seameet@seasalt.ai>**. We will be happy to assist you.

## 6. **How do I log in to SeaMeet?**

You can log in to SeaMeet using your Google account or register using your email.

## 7. **Can I edit already recorded transcripts?**

You can use the export to Google Docs feature to edit. Editing is currently not allowed on the SeaMeet meeting page, but this feature is expected to be supported soon.

## 8. **Can I download meeting audio files?**

Downloading meeting audio files is currently not allowed.

## 9. **Does SeaMeet support in-person meetings? Can I change the speaker?**

You can use a computer to open Google Meet for meeting recording during in-person meetings. However, features like changing the speaker for in-person meetings are not yet available and are expected to be provided in Q1 2024.

## 10. **If I have multiple workspaces, can I store meetings in different workspaces separately? Can I switch languages?**

If the meeting is scheduled in Google Calendar, the storage location and language will be determined according to the default language and default workspace in "Personal Settings - Meeting Settings". If you use the Chrome application to invite, you can specify which workspace to store it in.

## 11. **Why does SeaMeet Copilot still join the meeting even after I've turned off the auto-join feature?**

First, please disconnect your Google Calendar in order to stop SeaMeet Copilot from synchronizing with your Google Calendar. Go to **Account** -> **Integration** to disconnect Google Calendar. 

If after disconnecting, SeaMeet Copilot still joins the meeting, this is because the meeting was scheduled before the disconnection. In this case, you can manually remove the meeting from your meeting list. Go to **Meeting List** and find the future meetings with the turquoise background. Simply click on the trash can icon to delete the meeting.
