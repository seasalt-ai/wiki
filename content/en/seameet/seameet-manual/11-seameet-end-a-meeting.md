If you forget to manually end the meeting recording, the bot will leave the Google Meet room under the following conditions:

2. If a user remains in the meeting room, the bot will wait 15 minutes to confirm if the meeting is paused. If no one speaks within 15 minutes, the bot will automatically leave.
