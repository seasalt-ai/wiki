## üéØ Cutting-edge Accuracy
Speech technology is our specialty. We create our own models in-house using state of the art deep learning neural network algorithms.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Real-time Transcription & Synthesis
Real-time speed is essential when you're dealing with live conversation. We guarantee you'll never fall behind in a conversation because of slow transcription speeds.

## üìÇ Downloadable Transcription & Audio Files
Not only can you watch your transcriptions in real-time, but you can download them and save them for future use! Your voice-based conversations just became permanent, searchable, and shareable. Because all our transcriptions come with timestamps, you can even use them as subtitles.
