## SeaVoice Bot Introduction

üêô The SeaVoice Bot is a new Discord integration brought to you by Seasalt.ai, a startup run by some of the world‚Äôs leading experts in deep speech recognition, neural speech synthesis, and natural language processing. üêô

SeaVoice is a voice intelligence bot that uses advanced AI technology to improve the Discord voice channel experience. One of the great things about Discord‚Äôs text channels is that they maintain a permanent log of the server‚Äôs conversations. But what about the voice channels? Once something is said verbally in the channel, *it‚Äôs gone* - you can‚Äôt catch up on part of the conversation you missed or search the conversation later. 

Invite SeaVoice to the voice channel, and you can get real time speech transcriptions delivered to a chat channel as the conversation is happening. You'll also receive a final version of your transcript and voice recording in a DM after the session ends. SeaVoice is set apart from bots offering similar services because it‚Äôs backed by state-of-the-art deep learning models crafted by Seasalt.ai.

We feel that providing highly accurate transcriptions for voice channels is a huge accessibility improvement for Discord. Additionally, because transcriptions are automatically posted to a text channel, that means they are permanent, searchable, and shareable. Similarly, speech synthesis also boosts participation in voice channels by making them more accessible to people who can‚Äôt or don‚Äôt want to speak personally.

## Capabilities

### ‚úçÔ∏è Speech-to-Text
##### Transcribe Audio from Voice Channels

###### /recognize [language]

`/recognize [language]` -> Bot joins the voice channel you're currently in, and continues to listen and output transcription in real time to the chat channel. The bot will record and transcribe everyone in the voice channel. Transcriptions are output to the text channel where the initial slash command was entered. When the session ends, the bot will DM each participant a final transcription file and a link to a full audio download. The session will automatically wrap up if all the users leave the voice channel, or if the bot shuts down or restarts for any reason (such as when a new verison gets released).

###### Language Support

| Language          |
| ----------------- |
| English           |
| Mandarin (Taiwan) |

<p style="color:#19b6c0">Pro Tip #1:</p>

Use the `/recognize [language]` command from the voice channel chat window to see your transcriptions side-by-side with the participants or live stream!

<p style="color:#19b6c0">Pro Tip #2:</p>

If you want to temporarily stop the bot from listening to you (like pausing the session), you can right-click on the bot in the voice channel and check `Deafen Server`. This will prevent any audio data from being sent to the bot until it is un-checked. This way, you can pause the transcription and then pick your session back up when you're ready without having to stop and start a new one!

###### /stop

`/stop` -> Bot stops listening and leaves the voice channel. Upon running the stop command, each participant will recieve a DM with the full transcription and audio files.

### üó£ Text-to-Speech
#### Synthesize Speech from Chat to Voice Channel 

Seasalt.ai also excels at speech synthesis. We offer a text-to-speech command, which allows users to type in a chat channel and have audio synthesized and played in a particular voice channel for them.

###### /speak [voice] [text]
To use this command, you should already be in a voice channel. In any text channel, type the `/speak` slash command and then specify which `voice` you would like to use, and enter the `text` that you would like synthesized. You can see the available voices below:

| Name      | Sex | Language          |
| --------- | --- | ----------------- |
| Orca      | M   | American English  |
| Narwhal   | M   | British English   |
| Angelfish | F   | American English  |
| Starfish  | F   | Mandarin (Taiwan) |
| Dolphin   | F   | Mandarin (Taiwan) |

### üéôÔ∏è Record & Download
#### Export Audio from Voice Channels
Users are able to download their transcriptions and full audio recordings to a file.

When the STT session ends, the bot will DM each participant a final transcription file and a link to a full audio download. To download the audio, follow the link and then right click in the web browser and select "Save as...".

In the future we may offer downloads for different file types. Particularly, we plan to offer transcriptions in close-caption format so that they can be aligned with audio or video and used as subtitles.

## Language Support
Currently our text-to-speech and speech-to-text models support English and Taiwanese Mandarin. However, we're always working on creating new language models and improving our existing ones. We're working on new models for Vietnamese, Spanish, French, and more! We'd love to hear which languages you're most eager to use.

## Why SeaVoice?

#### üéØ Cutting-edge Accuracy
Speech techonology is our specialty. We create our own models in-house using state of the art deep learning neural network algorithms.

#### ‚è±Ô∏è Real-time Transcription and Synthesis
Real-time speed is essential when you're dealing with live conversation. We guarantee you'll never fall behind in a conversation because of slow transcription speeds.

#### üìÇ Downloadable Transcription and Audio Files
Not only can you watch your transcriptions in real-time, but you can download them and save them for future use! Your voice-based conversations just became permanent, searchable, and shareable. Because all our transcriptions come with timestamps, you can even use them as subtitles.
