## Decoder
-------------------

The **SeaVoice STT Decoder** achieves lightning fast speed for speech recognition with state-of-the-art accuracy. This will be evaluated using the following metrics:

- Real Time Factor (RTFx): Decoding speed relative to audio duration
- Word Error Rate (WER): Overall accuracy of the transcription

Here we compare our STT engine with Microsoft Azure STT where we achieve better accuracy and speed:
