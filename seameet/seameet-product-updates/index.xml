      <description>7/24/2025 # New Features and Improvements #  Added &amp;ldquo;Weekly Meeting Reminder Emails&amp;rdquo;, sent every Monday to help users stay on top of upcoming meetings. Fixed an issue where the full audio file was not available until the page was refreshed after a meeting ended. Fixed a bug where manually inviting the Copilot to a meeting marked as “Auto-Join Off” could cause the meeting to be hidden from the meeting list.</description>
