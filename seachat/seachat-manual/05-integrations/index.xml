      <description>SeaChat supports pre-filling user information in the webchat form by detecting query strings in the webchat URL. This allows seamless integration between your website and the chat widget, so your customers don‚Äôt need to enter their details manually.
    Why is this important? This is mostly used in scenarios where your end users have already logged into your system, then you can use their login info to auto fill in the contact form.</description>
