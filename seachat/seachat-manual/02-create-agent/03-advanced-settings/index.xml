It contains all the necessary information about your agent, including its name, description, and other advanced settings like memory fields. In this tutorial, we will walk you through each of the attribute that you will find in Agent Information under Agent Configuration.

However, LSTM is only used for within the language model itself, such as coreference resolution. In reality, we want a mechanism to remember certain attributes of a conversation or a user. We need a &amp;ldquo;long-lasting&amp;rdquo; memory so whenever the conversation resumes, the LLM still remembers its previous state.
Memory allows users to intuitively define the most important aspect of the conversation to keep dialogue relevant and to aid in objectively determining the conversation outcome.</description></item></channel></rss>
