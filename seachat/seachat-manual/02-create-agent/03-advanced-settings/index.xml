Enterprise  Premium  plans 
 Overview #  Large language models are based on the LSTM &amp;ndash; Long Short-Term Memory &amp;ndash; architecture. However, LSTM is only used for within the language model itself, such as co-reference resolution. In reality, we want a mechanism to remember certain attributes of a conversation or a user. We need a &amp;ldquo;long-lasting&amp;rdquo; memory so whenever the conversation resumes, the LLM still remembers its previous state.</description>
