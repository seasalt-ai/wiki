Not only can live agents take over the conversation, but they can also provide the virtual agent with new knowledge, and help train the virtual agent by testing and fine-tuning the response of the AI agent.
Depending on your SeaChat channel, it might take different configurations to enable the live agent feature.</description></item></channel></rss>
