This feature is useful when you want to create a new agent with similar settings as an existing agent.
To duplicate an agent, click on the Agent Duplicate button located next to the agent you want to duplicate in Agents under Workspace. This will create a new agent called {Agent Name} (COPY) with the same settings as the original agent.</description></item><item><title>Live Agent</title><link>https://wiki.seasalt.ai/seachat/seachat-manual/02-create-agent/02-live-agent-transfer/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 08:48:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wiki.seasalt.ai/seachat/seachat-manual/02-create-agent/02-live-agent-transfer/</guid><description>A live agent is a human agent who can take over the conversation from the AI agent when needed. Not only can live agents take over the conversation, but they can also provide the virtual agent with new knowledge, and help train the virtual agent by testing and fine-tuning the response of the AI agent.
Depending on your SeaChat channel, it might take different configurations to enable the live agent feature.</description></item></channel></rss>
