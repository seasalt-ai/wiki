Not only can live agents take over the conversation, but they can also provide the virtual agent with new knowledge, and help train the virtual agent by testing and fine-tuning the response of the AI agent.
Depending on your SeaChat channel, it might take different configurations to enable the live agent feature.</description></item><item><title>Agent Memory</title><link>https://wiki.seasalt.ai/seachat/seachat-manual/02-create-agent/03-agent-memory/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Apr 2024 08:48:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wiki.seasalt.ai/seachat/seachat-manual/02-create-agent/03-agent-memory/</guid><description>Overview # Large language models are based on the LSTM &amp;ndash; Long Short-Term Memory &amp;ndash; architecture. However, LSTM is only used for within the language model itself, such as coreference resolution. In reality, we want a mechanism to remember certain attributes of a conversation or a user. We need a &amp;ldquo;long-lasting&amp;rdquo; memory so whenever the conversation resumes, the LLM still remembers its previous state.
Memory allows users to intuitively define the most important aspect of the conversation to keep dialogue relevant and to aid in objectively determining the conversation outcome.</description></item></channel></rss>
