      <description>Agent Duplication #  üìçWhat is duplicated?
When an agent is duplicated or replaced, the agent&amp;rsquo;s basic info, advanced settings, knowledge base, and widget are concerned. Channels cannot be duplicated or replaced.
 Agent duplication is a feature that allows you to create a new agent based on an existing one. This is useful when you want to create a new agent with similar settings as an existing one.
To duplicate an agent, click on the Agent Duplicate button located next to the agent you want to duplicate in Agents under Workspace.</description>

      <description>A live agent is a human agent who can take over the conversation from the AI agent when needed. Not only can live agents take over the conversation, but they can also provide the virtual agent with new knowledge, and help train the virtual agent by testing and fine-tuning the response of the AI agent.
Depending on your SeaChat channel, it might take different configurations to enable the live agent feature.</description>
