      <description>1. How do I change the password for my Seasalt products? # All Seasalt products use the same password management mechanism. We only support logging in by sending a login code via email each time you log in, and we do not have a password change feature.
This approach helps prevent you from forgetting your password or inadvertently sharing it. To log in to any Seasalt product, simply enter your login email, and you will receive a login code.</description>
