      <description>5/15/2025 # New Features and Improvements #  Better document knowledge base upload handling: Fixed the bug that caused server timeout when uploading large documents. Now users can upload large documents and the system will process the upload as a background process, while users can work on something else. Messenger integration with FB embedded signup: We support FB embedded signup, and users can sign up with their FB account directly and choose which FB page to connect with their SeaChat AI agent.</description>
