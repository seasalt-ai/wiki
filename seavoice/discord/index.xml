      <description>‚úçÔ∏è Speech-to-Text # Transcribe Audio from Discord Voice Channels # /recognize [language] # /recognize [language] -&amp;gt; Bot joins the voice channel you&amp;rsquo;re currently in, and continues to listen and output transcription in real time to the chat channel. The bot will record and transcribe everyone in the voice channel. Transcriptions are output to the text channel where the initial slash command was entered. When the session ends, the bot will DM the session creator a final transcription file, an SRT-formatted transcript file (used for subtitles), and a link to a full audio download.</description>

      <description>SeaVoice currently supports 12 languages. The English and Mandarin (Taiwan) models are our own in-house models trained from scratch; they are highly accurate and reliable. However, we&amp;rsquo;re always working on creating new language models and improving our existing ones. We&amp;rsquo;d love to hear which languages you&amp;rsquo;re most eager to use! All other languages are supported using a multilingual open source model as the base. The performance wasn&amp;rsquo;t great out of the box, so we integrated it into our own STT pipeline and tuned the model to improve the performance.</description>
