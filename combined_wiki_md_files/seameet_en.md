<!-- Weight: 11 -->

*Manage SeaMeet workspace for meetings, team collaboration, and plans. Learn how to handle SeaMeet Workspace efficiently.*


A workspace is where you manage all meetings, team members, and plans. You can create a shared workspace for your company, department, or team, allowing invited users to jointly manage all meeting records stored in this workspace.

<img src="/images/seameet-en/05-seameet-workspace/seameet-workspace-management.png" alt="SeaMeet Workspace Management"/>

</center>

### Manage Meetings

Meeting records will be stored in the designated workspace. You can manage future, ongoing, or completed meetings in the workspace.

<center>

<img src="/images/seameet-en/05-seameet-workspace/manage-seameet-meetings.png" alt="Manage SeaMeet Meetings"/>

</center>

### Team Collaboration

You can invite team members to join the workspace on the "Workspace Settings - Users" page to collaboratively view and edit meeting records. You can also set different permissions to better manage the workspace.

Once you send the invitation, the invited users can register and log in using the link in the invitation email and join the invited workspace.

1. User permissions are divided into "Admin" and "Member".
2. Admin
    - Can view all meetings in the workspace.
    - Can delete meetings.
    - Can invite users to the workspace and grant any permissions.
    - Can remove users.
3. Member
    - Default can view all meetings in the workspace but can be adjusted to view personal meetings only.
    - Cannot delete meetings.
    - Can invite users to the workspace but can only invite as "Member".
    - Cannot remove users.

#### Team Workspace Management

<!-- Weight: 12 -->

*Manage multiple workspaces and users on SeaMeet. Learn how to streamline user management across workspaces.*


# About Workspace on Team Plan

If your organization purchased SeaMeet Team Plan, the workspace owner (the user account that created the first workspace) can create multiple workspaces and manage users on SeaMeet.

# Workspace Owner
The user account that creates the workspace will be considered Workspace Owner, and the subscribed plan will apply to all workspaces under their administration. 

If your team has multiple workspaces and you wish to use one subscription for all of them, please ensure that the workspace owner creates all the workspaces. For example, if the workspace owner creates two workspaces and subscribes to a team plan, then the team plan will apply to both workspaces.

<center>
<img src="/images/seameet-en/seameet-workspace-manager.png" alt="SeaMeet Workspace Manager"/>
</center>

※ If you cannot change workspace owner on SeaMeet portal, please contact us at [seameet@seasalt.ai](mailto:seameet@seasalt.ai).


# How to manage workspace members?

The workspace owner manages all users in workspace(s). The total number of unique accounts, excluding duplicates, is considered the total number of users.

For example, if the workspace owner invites colleagues A, B, C, and D to two workspaces, even if user B can access both workspaces, the subscription plan will only have 5 users (including the workspace owner), not 6 users.

<center>
<img src="/images/seameet-en/seameet-user-count.png" alt="SeaMeet - How to Count Number of Users"/>
</center>



※ If you have more questions about workspace management and pricing, please contact [seameet@seasalt.ai](mailto:seameet@seasalt.ai). We do offer custom plan for Enterprise users.

#### Auto Share Meeting Records

<!-- Source: seameet-manual/2-general-setup/10-seameet-sharing.md -->

<!-- Weight: 21 -->

*Auto-share SeaMeet meeting records via email. Learn how to share meeting records with team members or external partners.*


## Get Started

You can adjust the recipients of automatically shared meeting records in the **General** of the **Workspace**.

<br/>

<center>

<a href="/images/seameet-en/10-seameet-sharing/seameet-auto-sharing-setting-ui.png" target="_blank">

<img width="80%" style="border-radius: 0.4rem; cursor: zoom-in" src="/images/seameet-en/10-seameet-sharing/seameet-auto-sharing-setting-ui.png" alt="Set SeaMeet Auto Sharing Meeting Records"/>

</a>

*Auto Share Settings*

</center>

<br/>

You can set the auto-sharing feature in the **General**. Currently, SeaMeet offers the following options:

1. **Only share with me**

   When you invite the copilot to transcribe a meeting, the system will automatically send an email to your inbox once the meeting ends.

2. **All participants in calendar event**

   When you invite the copilot to transcribe a meeting and the meeting ends, the system will automatically send an email to all attendees invited via Google Calendar.

3. **Share with attendees who have the same domain as me**

   When the meeting ends, the system will automatically send an email to all attendees who have the same domain as you. For example, if I am using an email with the domain,`@seasalt.ai`, in a meeting where there are attendees using `@seasalt.ai` and `@client-company.com`, the system will only send the meeting record to attendees with the private domain of `@seasalt.ai` instead of `@client-company.com`. It only applies to those with private email addresses sharing your domain, not to those using public email domains like Gmail, Hotmail, and Outlook.

4. **Off for anyone including myself**

   No meeting records will be sent after the meeting ends.

If you enable the auto-sharing feature, the system will automatically send the meeting record via email to the designated recipients according to your auto-sharing settings after the meeting ends.

## Additional List

<br/>

<center>

<a href="/images/seameet-en/10-seameet-sharing/additional-list.png" target="_blank">

<img width="80%" style="border-radius: 0.4rem; cursor: zoom-in" src="/images/seameet-en/10-seameet-sharing/additional-list.png" alt="Set SeaMeet Auto Sharing Meeting Records"/>

</a>

*Auto Share - Additional List*

</center>

<br/>

The additional list allows you to send the meeting record to recipients who did not attend the meeting. You can send CC and BCC of the meeting record to additional recipients. The CC and BCC recipients can also be an email group.

One very useful feature of the additional list is the blocklist. When you choose the option to send the meeting record to all attendees in the calendar event, you can exclude certain attendees from receiving the meeting record by adding them to the blocklist.

Remember to enable the additional list feature first before you can use it.

*2. SeaMeet Interface – Select All Meetings in My Calendar*

</center>

## Google Calendar Settings

When scheduling a new meeting in Google Calendar, make sure to click add a video meeting, so that there is a video meeting link, and SeaMeet can correctly add the meeting to the list. Meetings without video meeting links will not be automatically joined by SeaMeet.

After completing the above steps, your Google Calendar will automatically be added to the SeaMeet meeting list, and it will automatically join at the start of the meeting.

[//]: # (<br/>)

[//]: # (<center>)

[//]: # (<a name="seameet-select-all-meetings-in-my-calendar" href="/images/seameet-en/16-seameet-auto-join/google-calendar-settings.png" target="_blank">)

</center>

## Disable Auto-join

First, please disconnect your Google Calendar in order to stop SeaMeet Copilot from synchronizing with your Google Calendar. Go to **Account** -> **Integration** to disconnect Google Calendar.

After disconnecting, if SeaMeet Copilot still joins the meeting automatically, it is because the meeting was scheduled before the disconnection. In this case, you can manually remove the meeting from your meeting list. Go to Meeting List and find the future meetings with the turquoise background. Simply click on the trash can icon to delete the meeting.

#### Identify Speakers in In-Person Meetings

<!-- Source: seameet-manual/2-general-setup/seameet-in-person-meeting.md -->

<!-- Weight: 24 -->

*Identify speakers in in-person meetings using SeaMeet, change speakers, and regenerate summaries based on updated transcripts.*


When recording in-person meetings using Google Meet, you can use features such as "Speaker ID". "Change Speakers," and "Regenerate Meeting Summary" to reassign and replace the correct speakers in the meeting transcript, and regenerate corresponding summaries based on the new speakers.

## Identifying Speakers

1. Based on the actual number of meeting participants, you can use "Identify Speakers" to resplit the transcript and specify how many speakers to distinguish

<br/>
<center>
<a name="seameet-identify-speakers-step1" href="/images/seameet-en/in-person-meetings/identify-speakers-dialog.png" target="_blank">
<img style="width: 80%" src="/images/seameet-en/in-person-meetings/identify-speakers-dialog.png" alt="SeaMeet dialog for identifying speakers"/>
</a>
</center>
<br/>

<br/>
<center>
<a name="seameet-identify-speakers-step1-alt" href="/images/seameet-en/in-person-meetings/specify-number-of-speakers.png" target="_blank">
<img style="width: 70%" src="/images/seameet-en/in-person-meetings/specify-number-of-speakers.png" alt="SeaMeet interface to specify number of speakers"/>
</a>
</center>
<br/>

2. During the speaker identification process, you can leave the meeting at any time and return to view the results when it's complete

<br/>
<center>
<a name="seameet-identify-speakers-step2" href="/images/seameet-en/in-person-meetings/speaker-identification-in-progress.png" target="_blank">
<img style="width: 80%" src="/images/seameet-en/in-person-meetings/speaker-identification-in-progress.png" alt="SeaMeet speaker identification in progress"/>
</a>
</center>
<br/>

3. When identification is complete, you can see participants distinguished as different speakers (e.g., Speaker 1, Speaker 2, Speaker 3)

<br/>
<center>
<a name="seameet-identify-speakers-step3" href="/images/seameet-en/in-person-meetings/identified-speakers-result.png" target="_blank">
<img style="width: 80%" src="/images/seameet-en/in-person-meetings/identified-speakers-result.png" alt="SeaMeet result of identified speakers"/>
</a>
</center>
<br/>

## Changing Speakers

After completing speaker identification, you can listen to individual speakers in the meeting (e.g., Speaker 1, Speaker 2, Speaker 3) to confirm and change to the correct speakers.

1. Listen to individual speaker recordings in the meeting and confirm the actual speakers

<br/>
<center>
<a name="seameet-change-speakers-step1" href="/images/seameet-en/in-person-meetings/listen-to-speakers.png" target="_blank">
<img style="width: 80%" src="/images/seameet-en/in-person-meetings/listen-to-speakers.png" alt="SeaMeet interface for listening to individual speakers"/>
</a>
</center>
<br/>

2. Choose an existing participant or create a new one to replace the original speaker

<br/>
<center>
<a name="seameet-change-speakers-step2" href="/images/seameet-en/in-person-meetings/choose-or-create-speaker.png" target="_blank">
<img style="width: 80%" src="/images/seameet-en/in-person-meetings/choose-or-create-speaker.png" alt="SeaMeet interface for choosing or creating a new speaker"/>
</a>
</center>
<br/>

3. Choose whether the "new speaker" should replace a single dialogue or all dialogue segments of the "old speaker"

<br/>
<center>
<a name="seameet-change-speakers-step3" href="/images/seameet-en/in-person-meetings/replace-speaker-options.png" target="_blank">
<img style="width: 60%" src="/images/seameet-en/in-person-meetings/replace-speaker-options.png" alt="SeaMeet options for replacing speaker segments"/>
</a>
</center>
<br/>

4. Once all speakers in the transcript have been replaced with the correct speakers, the transcript adjustment is complete

<br/>
<center>
<a name="seameet-change-speakers-step4" href="/images/seameet-en/in-person-meetings/transcript-adjustment-complete.png" target="_blank">
<img style="width: 80%" src="/images/seameet-en/in-person-meetings/transcript-adjustment-complete.png" alt="SeaMeet interface showing completed transcript adjustment"/>
</a>
</center>
<br/>

## Regenerating Meeting Summary

1. After replacing all speakers in the transcript, you can regenerate the meeting summary based on the adjusted transcript

<br/>
<center>
<a name="seameet-regenerate-summary-step1" href="/images/seameet-en/in-person-meetings/regenerate-summary-option.png" target="_blank">
<img style="width: 80%" src="/images/seameet-en/in-person-meetings/regenerate-summary-option.png" alt="SeaMeet option to regenerate meeting summary"/>
</a>
</center>
<br/>

2. During the process of regenerating the meeting summary, you can leave the meeting at any time and return to view it when it's complete

<br/>
<center>
<a name="seameet-regenerate-summary-step2" href="/images/seameet-en/in-person-meetings/summary-regeneration-in-progress.png" target="_blank">
<img style="width: 70%" src="/images/seameet-en/in-person-meetings/summary-regeneration-in-progress.png" alt="SeaMeet interface showing summary regeneration in progress"/>
</a>
</center>
<br/>

3. After completing the meeting summary, you can view the generated summary based on the new speakers

Note that each time a new digest is generated, a new email with the digest will be automatically sent. If your sharing settings are to also share with other attendees, everyone will receive a new email.

## 2. Apply templates to regular meetings

1. If you have a fixed routine meeting and want to apply a specific meeting summary template, such as "stand-up meeting" or "weekly meeting". If your meeting is invited by binding Google calendar or email, when you click the abstract template, you will automatically be asked whether you want to apply a fixed abstract template to this series of meetings.
2. After application, the template will be automatically applied whenever a new meeting of this series is created.

- Note: Regular meetings will be based on the applied template, not the default meeting template

## Transcriptions with SeaMeet Audio Upload

SeaMeet Copilot automatically transcribes scheduled meetings, but did you know you can also upload external audio files for transcription? This feature is perfect for meetings recorded outside the platform or other audio recordings requiring transcription.

---

### How to Upload Audio Files on SeaMeet

   Navigate to the **File List** page and click the **Upload Audio File** button.

<center>

<img src="/images/seameet-en/seameet-audio-upload/file-list-ui.png" alt="SeaMeet File List UI"/>

</center>

2. Select the Correct File Format:
   SeaMeet supports multiple audio file formats, such as:
   - **.mp3**
   - **.wav**
   - **.aac**
   - **.flac**
   - **.ogg**
   - **.opus**
   - **.m4a**
   - **.mp4**
   - **.webm**
   - **.wma**
   - **.wmv**

    - **Language of the Audio:** Choose the appropriate language.
    - **Meeting Title:** Add a descriptive title for easy reference.

<center>

<img src="/images/seameet-en/seameet-audio-upload/transcription-setting.png" alt="SeaMeet Transcription Settings"/>

### Why Use SeaMeet for Audio Transcriptions?

SeaMeet treats uploaded audio files just like its scheduled meetings, offering:

- **Editing Capabilities:** Fine-tune the transcript and summary.

<center>

<img width="80%" src="/images/seameet-en/seameet-audio-upload/summary.png" alt="SeaMeet Meeting Transcription Summary of Uploaded Recording"/>

</center>


- **Action Items and Discussed Topics:** Add and track key takeaways and topic discussion.

<center>

<img width="80%" src="/images/seameet-en/seameet-audio-upload/discussed-topic.png" alt="SeaMeet Meeting Transcription Discussed Topic of Uploaded Recording"/>

</center>

- **Collaboration Tools:** Share files with your team or integrate with Google Docs for streamlined workflows.

This feature is ideal for transcribing external recordings or unscheduled meetings, ensuring no conversation goes undocumented.


## **Speaker ID**

Speaker ID is a feature that helps the users of SeaMeet to further optimize their transcription experience. 

When a meeting has multiple speakers, it can be difficult to differentiate between them in the transcription. For documentation and meeting efficiency it is important to know who said what. 

This is done through a process called audio diarization. By providing the number of speakers in the audio file, SeaMeet can accurately diarize the audio into the said number.

Yet, unless the meetings are synchronized, the process of diarization can only give us the number of speakers that are identified. SeaMeet will only differentiate them using the generic naming like speaker 1 and speaker 2.

After identifying the speakers, the user can then label the speaker with the correct name. This will help the user to identify the speaker in the transcription by choosing the ***Change Speaker** after clicking on the name.

<center>

<img width="80%" src="/images/seameet-en/seameet-audio-upload/change-speaker.png" alt="Change Speaker UI"/>

</center>

Choose a name from your contact.

<center>

<img width="80%" src="/images/seameet-en/seameet-audio-upload/choose-speaker.png" alt="Choose Speaker Step"/>

</center>

Users can change the speaker name throughout the whole conversation or just the chosen line. 


<center>

<img width="80%" src="/images/seameet-en/seameet-audio-upload/change-name-confirmation.png" alt="Change Name Confirmation"/>

</center>

By enabling the Speaker ID feature, users can leverage Seasalt.ai's expertise in audio diarization to differentiate speakers in an audio file for even more accurate transcription results.



> Note: Speaker ID is the best for 2-6 people, the more people you add, the performance degrades.

#### Email Copilot

<!-- Source: seameet-manual/3-meeting-copilot/16-seameet-email-copilot.md -->

<!-- Weight: 39 -->




**Introduction**

SeaMeet is an AI-powered meeting assistant designed to streamline post-meeting workflows. Unlike traditional tools that require users to copy transcripts into external Large Language Model (LLM) tools (like ChatGPT or Claude), SeaMeet utilizes an "Agentic Email" workflow. This allows users to generate summaries, draft emails, create GitHub tickets, and write Statements of Work (SOW) directly by replying to an email thread, eliminating the need to switch tabs or copy-paste context.

<iframe width="100%" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VpJgd6G-6K4?si=_A1sKG7T1XpmWDmc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="border-radius: 30px;"/></iframe>

**What you will learn in this video:**

Most AI meeting tools force you to switch tabs and lose context. SeaMeet changes the game by bringing the AI directly into your email thread. Watch how we go from a raw meeting recording to a finished Statement of Work and GitHub tickets without ever leaving Gmail.

<img src="/images/seameet-en/seameet-email-copilot-en.jpg" alt="Agentic Email followup right after meetings"/>
</center>

**Prerequisites**

To begin using SeaMeet effectively, ensure you have the browser extension installed:

* **Download:** [SeaMeet Chrome Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/seameet-take-chatgpt-meet/gkkhkniggakfgioeeclbllpihmipkcmn?utm_source=SeaMeet&utm_medium=Website&utm_campaign=Landing_Btn_Click&pli=1)
* **Account:** Sign up at [SeaMeet.ai](https://seameet.ai)

**The Agentic Workflow: Step-by-Step**

**1. Record Your Meeting**
Start your meeting (via Zoom, Google Meet, or Microsoft Teams) with SeaMeet enabled. The tool will record and transcribe the session in real-time.

**2. Receive the Summary Email**
Once the meeting concludes, SeaMeet Copilot automatically sends an email to your inbox. This email contains:

* A summary of the discussion.
* Suggested action items.
* A "Reply" prompt feature.

**3. Interact with the Copilot (The "Reply" Method)**
Instead of taking the transcript to a separate AI tool, simply hit **Reply** to the summary email. You can ask SeaMeet Copilot to perform specific tasks using natural language.

* *Example:* "Draft a follow-up email to the client summarizing the next steps."
* *Example:* "Create a formal Statement of Work (SOW) based on the pricing discussed."

**4. Receive Generated Content**
SeaMeet will process your request and reply to the same email thread with the generated content. This keeps the context history intact within one conversation.

**5. Iterate and Refine**
Because the context is preserved in the email thread, you can reply again to refine the output.

* *Example:* "Make the email more polite."
* *Example:* "Change the SOW format to a bulleted list."

**Advanced Use Cases**

* **Project Management Integration:** You can ask SeaMeet to convert meeting notes into technical formats. For example: *"Create a detailed GitHub issue ticket in Markdown format for the team."* SeaMeet will generate the code block ready for copy-pasting.
* **Sales & Legal Documents:** Generate complex documents like SOWs or proposals by referencing the specific details mentioned in the meeting audio.
* **Contextual History:** All iterations are saved within the email thread. If you need to revisit why a decision was made months later, the entire conversation history with the AI is preserved in your inbox.

* The ability to run up to 3 meetings simultaneously

We recommend subscribing to as many accounts as the number of members who need to record meetings.
For full team adoption of SeaMeet, please **contact us**.

## 9. **What is a workspace?**

A workspace is where you manage all your meetings, team members, and subscription plans.

### **9-1. How do I manage meetings in a workspace?**

All transcribed meeting notes are stored in the workspace. You can manage them whether they are upcoming, ongoing, or completed.

### **9-2. How do I collaborate in a workspace with my team?**

You can invite team members to join the workspace to view and edit meeting notes together. You can also set different permissions for better workspace management.

### **9-3. How do I choose a plan?**

If you need more transcription hours or advanced features, you can **upgrade your plan** or **contact our support team \<email: [seameet@seasalt.ai](mailto:seameet@seasalt.ai)>** for assistance.

## 10. **How do I log in to SeaMeet?**

You can log in using your Google or Microsoft account, or register with an email address.

## 11. **Do you support Google Education accounts?**

Yes, SeaMeet supports Google Education accounts.

However, due to Google’s restrictions, you cannot directly invite the SeaMeet bot to a meeting initiated by an Education account.
To enable this feature, please email [seameet@seasalt.ai](mailto:seameet@seasalt.ai), and we will help activate your account so the bot can join your future meetings.

## 12. **Can I edit transcripts that have already been recorded?**

You can export transcripts to Google Docs for editing. Editing directly within the SeaMeet meeting page is not yet supported.

## 13. **If I have multiple workspaces, can I store meetings separately? Can I switch languages?**

For meetings scheduled in Google Calendar, the storage location and language depend on your **Account → Meeting Preference** (default language and workspace).

If using the Chrome extension to invite the bot, you can specify which workspace to store the meeting in.

## 14. **Why does SeaMeet Copilot still join meetings even after I disable auto-join?**

First, disconnect your Google Calendar to stop synchronization.
Go to **Account Settings → Integrations** and remove the Google Calendar connection.

For meetings scheduled before the disconnection, manually delete them from the meeting list:
Go to **Meeting List**, find the future meeting with a light-blue background, and click the trash icon to delete.

## 15. **As a subscriber, can I re-invite Copilot if it leaves a meeting?**

Yes. You can re-invite Copilot by going to your meeting list and clicking **Start New Recording**.

## 16. **If I use a non-subscriber account to host a meeting, can subscribers still view the meeting notes?**

Yes. If a subscriber invites Copilot to the meeting, they can view the meeting notes.
Subscribers can also enable **Auto Sharing** to share notes with all invited participants:
Go to **General → Auto Share → All participants in calendar event (recommended)**.

For details, see our [guide](https://wiki.seasalt.ai/en/seameet/sharing/).

## 17. **If a subscriber attends a meeting hosted by another user, can they still receive the meeting notes?**

* If the subscriber invited Copilot → They will receive notes.
* If they did not invite Copilot → They will not receive notes, unless the host enabled Auto Sharing.

## 18. **Where can I see the emails set for auto-sharing?**

Go to **Workspace → General → Auto Sharing** to view the list of auto-share emails.

## 19. **Do I need to confirm invitation emails for Copilot to join meetings?**

No. As long as Copilot is invited and you have enough transcription minutes, it will automatically join.

## 20. **Do I have to use Google Calendar to invite Copilot?**

No. SeaMeet provides multiple ways to invite Copilot. See our [guide](https://wiki.seasalt.ai/seameet/seameet-manual/01-seameet-intro/) for more details.

## 21. **Can Copilot join multiple meetings simultaneously for subscribers?**

Only Team plan users can run multiple concurrent meetings. Individual plan users can only host one meeting at a time.

## 22. **How long are meetings stored in the meeting list? Can I see which one lasted the longest?**

Currently, meetings do not expire. You can view each meeting’s duration in the meeting list.

## 23. **What happens when I exceed my included meeting hours? Will I be notified?**

Once you exceed your plan’s hours, you’ll be charged \$1 per additional hour.
You can check your remaining and used minutes at the bottom of the sidebar anytime.

## 24. **Will Copilot stop recording when my included hours are used up?**

Only in two cases:

1. Free plan users exceed 6 total hours.
2. A single meeting exceeds time limits (1 hour for Free, 5 hours for paid plans).

## 25. **What if my meeting uses multiple languages, e.g., English and Chinese?**

We recommend setting the meeting language to the primary language.
If switching languages mid-meeting, adjust settings accordingly to ensure both are captured.

## 26. **Can I use SeaMeet to record meeting video?**

No. SeaMeet currently only supports transcription and audio recording, not video.

## 27. **Can I download recordings or export data from SeaMeet?**

* Only **Individual** and **Team** users can download audio. Free users can only listen on the platform.
* SeaMeet integrates with Google Drive, where all meeting records can be stored, owned, and shared by you.

## 28. **If the bot leaves a meeting, how do I re-invite it on mobile?**

Two scenarios:

1. **Meeting not previously recorded**: Invite `meet@seasalt.ai` via Google Calendar.
2. **Meeting already recorded**: Log in to SeaMeet → Meeting List → Start Meeting → Paste Google Meet ID.

⚠️ *Important*: Ensure the previous recording has fully ended before re-inviting.

## 29. **How do I ensure auto-join uses Team plan hours instead of Personal?**

SeaMeet determines billing based on the **workspace where the meeting is stored**.
To use Team hours, set the Team workspace as the default:
**Account → Meeting Preference → Default Workspace**

## 30. **What are the main differences between Team and Individual plans?**

1. Team plan allows multiple users to access transcripts, download audio, and export to Google Docs.
2. Team plan allows multiple concurrent Copilot sessions; Individual only allows one at a time.

## 31. **Why wasn’t my meeting fully recorded?**

Possible reasons:

* Bot was not admitted by the host
* Bot was removed during the meeting
* Recording or transcript processing failed

If the bot stayed throughout but data is missing, please email [seameet@seasalt.ai](mailto:seameet@seasalt.ai) with the meeting link.

## 32. **Why can’t the bot join and keeps spinning?**

Check if the host received the bot’s join request.
If not, verify in the SeaMeet meeting list whether the meeting was created successfully.

## 33. **Why does my meeting audio show “file not found”?**

Audio may still be processing within 5 minutes after the meeting ends.
If not available after 10 minutes, email [seameet@seasalt.ai](mailto:seameet@seasalt.ai) with the meeting link.

## 34. **How is recording time calculated?**

Time is only counted when the bot successfully joins the meeting.
Calendar-linked auto-join attempts do not consume minutes unless admitted.

Usage resets monthly for paid plans.

## 35. **Can non-hosts invite SeaMeet to record a meeting?**

Yes, but the host must admit the bot.
The bot will retry joining every 1–2 minutes until admitted.

If the host is also a SeaMeet user, they can invite using their account.

## 36. **What if I exceed the included plan hours?**

You can continue recording, but additional charges apply (see pricing chart).

## 37. **Why do meeting summary emails now link to SeaMeet instead of Google Docs?**

* Workspace users → redirected to SeaMeet meeting page
* Non-workspace users → redirected to a share-only page (view-only)
* Unauthorized users → blocked view (masked content)

This ensures both convenience and security.

## 38. **Where can I manage sharing permissions for meeting notes?**

Each meeting has its own **share list**.
Click the **Share** button on the meeting page to manage or approve viewer access.

If “Share with calendar attendees” is enabled, attendees are auto-added.

## 39. **How do I subscribe to an annual plan?**

Annual subscription is under development.
For now, contact [seameet@seasalt.ai](mailto:seameet@seasalt.ai) for manual setup.

## 40. **Why does my subscription cycle end this month? Why isn’t it \$9.99 flat?**

Subscriptions run from the 1st to the end of each month.
Mid-month signups are prorated. (e.g., signup on 4/20 → pay 1/3 of \$9.99).

## 41. **Does adding admins or members increase costs?**

Yes. Each additional Team user seat incurs extra charges, billed the following month.

## 42. **Why can’t I remove my credit card directly?**

To prevent unpaid balances (usage, added seats), card removal isn’t allowed while subscribed.
When unsubscribed, we can assist with card removal manually.

Annual plans are available with one-time payments (wire transfer possible).

## 43. **Can SeaMeet improve recognition of industry-specific terms?**

Yes. Please provide a glossary of commonly misrecognized terms for correction.

## 44. **How can I change my password?**

Currently, login is via Google, Microsoft, or OTP.
Password login is only for project clients and not user-editable.

## 45. **Can I delete my account or workspace?**

Direct deletion is not available.
You can unlink Google Calendar to stop auto-join.

If you need deletion, email [seameet@seasalt.ai](mailto:seameet@seasalt.ai). ⚠️ Once deleted, workspaces cannot be restored.

## 46. **Is SeaMeet secure?**

Yes. Security is our top priority.

* See our [Terms of Service](https://seasalt.ai/terms/) and [Privacy Policy](https://seasalt.ai/privacy).
* Web Application Firewall via Azure & AWS.
* FIPS-compliant encryption.
* CASA Level 2 security, Nessus scans, HECVAT certification, U.S. data residency.

## 47. **Can the bot auto-join meetings without host approval?**

No. Due to security concerns, host approval is always required.

See [documentation](https://wiki.seasalt.ai/en/seameet/audio-upload/).

## 48. **Can I change the bot’s nickname?**

Not at this time.

## 49. **Can I disable the bot from speaking in meetings?**

No. This is restricted by security policy.

## 50. **How do I disable the SeaMeet pop-up window in Google Meet?**

The pop-up is part of the Chrome extension.
Click the extension icon (top-right) → Manage Extensions.
